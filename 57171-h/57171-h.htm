    <div>THE CHALLENGE</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, girls, isn’t it just splendid?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And the rings are too sweet for anything; aren’t
they, really?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But what are they for—those seven marks,
I mean? I heard Mrs. Bonnell mention it, but
there was so much going on that I’ve forgotten.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, Alice! Don’t you recall that those seven
‘marks’, as you call them, are the seven points of
the law of the Camp Fire Girls?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“To which delightful organization we now belong,”
added another of the quartette.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, Natalie!” exclaimed Alice Lathrop,
“you’re a dear, but you always did have the most
remarkable remembrancer,” and, with a laugh she
put her arms around her chum, whose dark,
olive-tinted complexion, with that calm brow, and eyes,
in the depths of which woodland pools seemed to
lie, gave her the appearance of an Indian maid, especially
when she plaited her hair in two, long
black braids.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s quite symbolic,” went on Mabel Anderson,
as she looked at the silver ring on one of the
slim fingers of her pretty hand, a hand of which
she was perhaps a trifle vain—excusably so, in the
opinion of some of her friends.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And now we are really ‘Wood Gatherers,’”
spoke Marie Pendleton. “It’s the first step. I
wonder if we will take the others?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I intend to,” declared Alice. “It only takes
three months to become a ‘Fire Maker,’ and three
more to be a ‘Torch Bearer.’”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, but there are lots of things to do in that
time,” sighed Mabel Anderson. “Think of the
test of getting two meals for—for you girls!” and
she looked with pretended dismay at her three
pretty chums. “I—I don’t even know how to peel
potatoes!” and she covered her face with her
hands.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s time you learned,” declared Marie, who,
since the death of her mother kept house, with the
assistance of a maid, for her father, and her brother
Jack.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I can see all sorts of jolly times ahead of us!”
exclaimed Alice. “We will get to know ever so
many nice girls—really we four are too much by
ourselves.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“We always have been,” said Mabel. “I don’t
see why we shouldn’t continue to go together. Just
because we have joined the Camp Fire Girls doesn’t
mean that we’re going to separate, I hope. Shall
we make new friends and lose our old ones?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Not at all,” went on Alice. “But we are too—too—what
was it Professor Battell said in class
to-day—too inscribed—no, that wasn’t it——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Circumscribed,” put in Natalie.</p>

<p class='c009'>“That’s it. I don’t know what I’d do if I didn’t
have you for a memo. pad, Nat!” and once more
Alice embraced her chum.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why so pensive?” asked Marie, as, to give entrance
for her friends she opened the door of the
little cottage, over which she presided as mistress.
“Has anything happened, Natalie? Did you miss
in Latin to-day?” and Marie, dropping her books
on a chair in the hall ushered her chums into the
little library. The girls were on their way home
from the Academy and from class had gone to a
meeting of the Camp Fire Girls Association, which
had recently been started in their town. They had
been initiated as “Wood Gatherers” of the Dogwood
Camp Fire, which name Mrs. Pierce Bonnell,
the Guardian, had chosen for the group.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, nothing has happened,” said Natalie
slowly. “I was just thinking what delightful fun
we would have this summer if we could really
gather around a camp fire of our own, out in the
open.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, why couldn’t we?” asked Marie. “Let’s
think about it, anyhow. I’m going to ask Nellie
to make tea. It’s real chilly, even if the bluebirds
are here and the flowers almost out. Oh, I have
it, I’m going to choose the name Bluebird—I wonder
what that is in Indian?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Che-no-sag-ak!” exclaimed a guttural voice, as
Marie opened the door of the dining room. “Che-no-sag-ak!
Wah! Pale face maiden heap talk
much. Ugh!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh Jack! How you startled me!” cried Marie,
shrinking back, with her hands to her breast, as
she beheld her brother and his two intimate chums,
Phil Anderson and Blake Lathrop, calmly seated
at the dining room table, luxuriously regaling themselves
on water crackers and old cheese, with some
ginger ale which they had evidently smuggled in
from the corner grocery.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What is it?” echoed the voice of Mabel, as she
and the other two girls crowded to the portal.
“Phil!” she went on, “and Blake! Have you
been listening to what we were saying?” she demanded
as she marched out and stood half-threateningly
over her brother.</p>

<p class='c009'>“How could we help it—the way you talked?”
he inquired, defensively.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And so Marie is going to be a bluebird; is
she?” went on Jack with a grin. “Fine! That’s
the Indian for it that I was reciting—‘Che-no-sag-ak!’
Little bluebird of the wildwood, come and let
me have thy feathers—have thy feathers for my new
hat, for my new hat made of satin. Little——”</p>

<p class='c009'>His voice died off into a gurgle for Alice, with
the intimacy of a chum of Jack’s sister, had clapped
her hands over his mouth, to the destruction of a
cracker he had been about to munch.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Look out for that cheese!” warned Phil.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And the carpet!” added Blake.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, let him stop making fun!” snapped Alice,
as she glided away before Jack could take a fair
revenge.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What’s it all about, anyhow?” asked Blake,
when quiet had been somewhat restored. “Why
all this Indian hocus-pocus? Has a medicine show
come to town?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s the Camp Fire Girls,” declared Jack, trying
to get up from the carpet some of the cracker
crumbs before Nellie, the maid came in, for Jack
and his chums were only in the dining room on
sufferance. “Sis has been mooning around the
house about it for the last three weeks.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I have not, Jack Pendleton!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Gibbering about Wood-gatherers, Fire-makers,
and what not,” went on the irrepressible brother.
“She’s been looking in the back of the dictionary
for something or other—I thought she had fallen
down on her Latin, and was trying to work off a
condition.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I was looking for Indian words,” declared
Marie, “only I couldn’t find any. You know we can
each choose an Indian name,” she went on to her
girl chums, ignoring the three boys. “It may be
anything, only it ought to mean something in English.
But my dictionary doesn’t have any Indian
information in it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I have an Indian book at home,” said Blake
Lathrop quietly, speaking to all, but looking rather
more intently at Natalie. “I think it has a lot of
names such as ‘bluebird’ in it. If you girls want
to pick out titles for yourselves I’ll bring it over.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, will you, really?” cried Mabel. “I want
an Indian name, too, if the rest are going to have
them.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Say, what is this Camp Fire Girls’ racket, anyhow?”
asked Phil. “I’ve heard you talking about
it, Mabel, but I thought it was one of the Academy
societies.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s nothing of the sort,” declared Alice, while
Natalie went to the piano and softly played a weird
Indian song, in a haunting minor key.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, what is it?” asked Jack, finishing the
last of his crackers and cheese, and gallantly offering
Alice what was left of the ginger ale.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, thank you,” interposed his sister. “I’m going
to ask Nellie to make us some tea. We’re all
shivering.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The Camp Fire Girls is an organization something
like the Boy Scouts,” went on Alice.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I used to belong,” remarked Blake, as he walked
over ostensibly to look at the picture on the wall—the
said picture being very close to the piano at
which Natalie was softly playing.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, the Camp Fire Girls are like the Scouts,”
continued Alice, “only different. It isn’t so military.
The camp fire is our symbol, and our seven
laws are—‘seek beauty’——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“None of <i>you</i> have to!” declared Jack gallantly,
bowing with his hand on his heart.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Thank you!” chorused the trio, Marie being
out in the kitchen interviewing the maid.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Go on, Alice,” urged Natalie.</p>

<p class='c009'>“‘Seek beauty,’” resumed the girl, “‘give service—pursue
knowledge—be trustworthy—hold on
to health—glorify work—be happy.’ There, I think
I’ve said them right.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You have,” murmured Mabel.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Very nice,” asserted Phil.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And there are three degrees,” proceeded Alice.
“We have just joined, so we are humble wood-gatherers,
may it please your gracious highnesses,”
and she dropped a pretty courtesy to the boys.
“After three months’ service as such, we may become
fire-makers, and that’s a lot harder. And then
the next is torch-bearer, which is harder still. But
we’re not worrying about that. See our rings—aren’t
they dears?” and she held out her hand which
Jack promptly captured, to the discomfiture of Phil,
who had also made an attempt at the slim fingers.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then from the piano, which had suddenly ceased
its melody there came a voice:</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, Blake, you mustn’t take off my ring—really.
Oh, stop—there, you’ve dropped it!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Shame on you Blake!” mocked Phil, “to
treat a poor girl so. Let me see your ring, Marie,”
he went on, as the pretty hostess came into the room
again.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m too busy,” she called to him. “You may
help me get out the cups and saucers if you will,
though,” she added.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Let me be a wood-gatherer,” pleaded Jack.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Me for the fire-maker!” declared Blake.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You’ve got enough to do right there,” mocked
Jack. “We will call you the Greek chorus.”</p>

<p class='c009'>And thus the merry quips and gibes went on
until tea was served, the boys stoically remaining,
and, perforce requiring to be fed, though Marie
remarked to Jack sotto-voice that she thought he
had had one lunch since school.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am always open for more,” he replied.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And so you girls are really going to be members
of the Camp Fire club,” spoke Phil, when the
rattle of teacups had ceased.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Of Dogwood Camp,” added Natalie, daintily
removing a bit of butter from the tip of her finger
encircled by the new silver ring.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, it may all be very nice and romantic, and
that sort of thing,” began Jack, “but——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It isn’t romantic at all,” interrupted Alice.
“It’s practical—at least I think that’s the proper
word,” and she looked rather doubtfully at
Natalie.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, say, we’re forgetting all about our Indian
names,” exclaimed Marie. “I wonder what signified bluebird?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Wash-ton-su-goo!” gurgled her brother.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Jack!” she cried. “If you don’t stop I’ll never
let you stay in when we have tea again. You’re
too——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“All right, sis!” he laughed. “I’ll be good.
Only it’s such a joke.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“We’re really in earnest,” explained Natalie.
“You should see our rules, and learn how we can
acquire merit——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Like the Hindoo Yogis,” declared Phil.
“Natalie, the dreamer, talking of acquiring merit.
Say, if you girls get to have any more merit you’ll
be too good for this earth.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Be quiet!” begged Mabel. “Blake, did you say
you had an Indian book at home?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I have. Shall I get it?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Listen, girls!” called Mabel. “Why can’t you
all come over to my house this evening, and we’ll
select our names. Blake only lives around the corner.
He can leave the book, and——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Leave it!” exclaimed Blake, with peculiar emphasis.
“Perhaps I had better <i>mail</i> it, or send it
parcels post, or call a messenger from the telegraph
office. Only there’s none there after supper. However——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, I suppose you can bring it—and <i>stay</i>—if
you want to,” conceded Mabel.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Not a pressing invitation, but—shall we take
it, fellows?” and Blake looked quizzically at his
chums.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We can tell them how to make a camp fire,
anyhow,” declared Jack.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Thank you, we’re going to learn by practical
experience, Jack,” spoke his sister.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then all come to my house this evening,”
went on Mabel. “And, Blake, please bring the Indian
book. Phil can entertain you and Jack while
we look up some names.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And who will entertain you?” inquired Jack.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Thank you—we don’t need it,” spoke Natalie.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, I’m willing to wager my new hat against
a hair ribbon,” declared Phil, “that with all you
girls talking about wood-gathering and camp fires,
not one of your crowd would dare go camping and
build a real camp fire—I mean a party of you. It’s
all very well to talk about being like the boy scouts,
but when it comes down to the real thing, you’ll
be so afraid of an ant crawling on a stick of wood
that you’ll want an oil stove to cook on. Camp fire
girls may be——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Stop!” commanded Mabel. “In the first place,
Phil, the Camp Fire Girls’ organization wasn’t
formed to go out in the woods, though lots of them
do. We can have just as good a time at home.
But, for all that, we do intend to go camping, and
to make our own camp fires, too!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mabel!” gasped Natalie.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, Mabel!” whispered Marie.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Who ever said that?” demanded Alice.</p>

<p class='c009'>There was a momentous pause.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We seem to have stirred up trouble,” said
Blake softly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“They’ll never go camping!” came from Jack.
“Here, I’ll offer a challenge—we all will. If you
girls go to a genuine, bonafide camp, live by yourselves
in tents, make the camp fire, cook your own
meals, the same as we fellows do—why we’ll come
up and see you once in a while. How’s that?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And bring you each a two-pound box of the
best candy in town,” added Phil.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And take back all we’ve said,” went on Blake.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Boys,” began Mabel, somewhat solemnly,
“we never gave this consideration until now. That
is the others didn’t. But it has been in my mind
since we thought of becoming Camp Fire Girls. I
don’t see why we can’t go off in the woods this
summer. It would be jolly,—I think.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Lovely,” breathed Natalie.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’ll go if the others do,” conceded Alice.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We’d have to have a chaperone,” remarked
Marie.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mrs. Bonnell, our Guardian, would come, I
think,” suggested Mabel.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then let’s accept the boys’ challenge!” exclaimed
Natalie. “I don’t see why we can’t make
a fire as well as they. As for cooking, there is so
much that comes canned now that it’s really no
trouble at all. We always live on canned things
when our girl leaves.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then it’s decided!” echoed Mabel, clapping her
hands. “We’ll become real Camp Fire Girls.
Now I must be going. Don’t forget—come over
this evening. And, Phil, bring that Indian book.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I will,” he promised.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Say, do you think they will go camping?”
asked Jack, as his two chums took their leave, while
his sister led her girl friends to her room to show
a new dress she had bought.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Never!” cried Blake. “They’re just bluffing.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It wouldn’t be a bad plan for us to go camping
ourselves this summer,” remarked Phil.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’ll go you!” cried Jack.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’ll think about it,” agreed Blake.</p>

<p class='c009'>“He means he’ll go if the girls do,” put in Jack.
“Well, I’ll see you this eve.,” and with that he pretended
to dig into some of his Academy studies,
for he and his friends, as did the girls, went to
the same institution in the little semi-country town
of Middleford.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Did you really mean what you said, Mabel,
about going camping?” asked Natalie, as the
three walked away from Marie’s house, some time
later, having in the interim found many matters
about which to chat.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I didn’t at first—but when I saw how the boys
took me up I did. I don’t see why we can’t do it—and
be real Camp Fire Girls.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“We can,” declared Alice with decision.</p>

<p class='c009'>“There goes a real Camp Fire Girl now,” added
Natalie in a low voice, as she indicated, walking
slowly down the village street ahead of them, a figure
clad in rather a gaudy skirt, a Zouave jacket,
and a sash of oriental hues.</p>

<p class='c009'>“A Gypsy,” murmured Alice.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, there is an encampment of them just outside
of town,” went on Natalie. “One came to
our house the other day, wanting to tell fortunes.
It’s romantic, in a way, I suppose, but she didn’t
tell our girl anything that I couldn’t have told her
myself.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s the out-door life that appeals to me!” declared
Alice. “That’s why I like the Camp Fire
Girls. We can make our organization an excuse
for all sorts of adventures.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, we certainly may have some if we go
camping,” suggested Natalie, as they separated at
a corner. “Good-bye.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Until to-night,” suggested Mabel.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Until to-night,” echoed Alice.</p>

<p class='c009'>And little did the girls realize what the events of
that night were to bring forth; nor how they were
to exert an influence on their lives. For that Gypsy
played a strange part in the experience of the Camp
Fire Girls.</p>

    <div>A MISSING RING</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>“Here come the boys!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, I do hope they won’t cut-up too much!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“They’re sure to make a lot of fun!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I hope Blake brings that Indian book he
promised.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Four girls, gathered about a table in the library
of the Anderson home, listened as the tramp of
feet was heard on the porch that May evening.
There were whispers, and then a weird whoop
echoed.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Horrid things!” pouted Mabel. “I told Phil
if he didn’t behave he couldn’t come in.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ha-nah-do-see-dah—kam-chat-kah!” called a
voice. “Little maidens of the camp fire!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, behave yourselves!” ordered Mabel, going
to the door, but she could not smother the laughter
out of her voice, and it broke into a merry peal as
she beheld her brother and his two chums.</p>

<p class='c009'>They stood on the steps, wrapped in old blankets,
their faces outlined with colored chalk, and parts
of a feather duster tied in their hair.</p>

<p class='c009'>“How!” gutturally mumbled Phil, as he stalked
into the hall, followed by Jack and Blake.</p>

<p class='c009'>“How! How!” echoed the others.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We come for heap big peace-talk,” went on
Phil.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, don’t be silly!” admonished his sister, but
the boys preserved their gravity, even if she did not,
and her half-hysterical laughter brought her friends
from the library.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Aren’t they funny!” exclaimed Natalie, who,
having no brother of her own, might be expected
to take more than a casual interest in those of other
girls.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Thank you, pale-faced maiden,” spoke Blake.
“You are as the breath of the pine tree, and——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, what a lovely name,” murmured Natalie.
“I wish I could have it for mine. Are there any
Indian words for that, Blake?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It is written in the book, pale-faced maiden—Chee-ne-Sagoo—breath
of the pine tree.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Isn’t it beautiful—the name I mean,” she said,
as she accepted the volume the blanketed Blake
held out.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It is like thyself, pale-faced maiden,” and he
bowed.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, that’s enough of this silliness!” exclaimed
Mabel, breaking away from her brother who had
tried to rub off some of the chalk from his cheeks
to hers.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Wow!” yelled Jack, as he threw off his covering,
his almost too-realistic war-whoop giving the
girls starts of fright. “Come on to the council
fire. It is chilly, even if it is May,” and, followed
by the others they filed into the pleasant library.</p>

<p class='c009'>“First of all, let’s choose names,” suggested
Mabel. “Did you look up any, Blake?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“There are quite a number in the book,” he explained.
“I marked some. They’re not all in the
same Indian language, but that won’t matter I
guess.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Not as long as they sound er—what’s that
word we had in the lit. class the other day?” and
Alice appealed to her chums.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Euphonious,” suggested Natalie.</p>

<p class='c009'>“That’s it! As long as they sound nice, and
have some meaning, I don’t care whether mine is
Chocktaw or Sioux.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Say my name over again, Blake,” appealed
Natalie. “Whisper of the pine tree—was that it?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Very nearly. Chee-ne-Sagoo—breath of the
pine tree—and it becomes you,” he added in a
whisper.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Silly,” she remarked, in the same tone.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Did you find a word for bluebird?” asked
Marie.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The nearest I could get to it was bluebird of
the mountain,” replied Blake, leafing over the book.
“Here it is in Indian—wah-tu-go-mo.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Not so bad,” commented Marie. “That will
be my name.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Here are two more I picked out, though if you
don’t like them I dare say I can find more,” and
Blake read from a slip of paper:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Wep-da-se-nah—maiden of the green corn, and
no-moh-te-nah—sweeper of the tepee. The last
isn’t very romantic,” he apologized, “but it sounds
nice—in Indian.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I guess that fits me,” laughed Alice. “Father
says I’m always sweeping and dusting. I’ll take it,
unless you want it, Mabel.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You may have it. I like maiden of the green
corn.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Even though you can’t boil water without burning
it,” mocked Phil. “Go ahead—the more different
the merrier.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Is that a riddle?” asked Natalie.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, it’s the truth.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I think those names are just lovely!” declared
Marie. “Let’s see now: chee-ne-sagoo—breath of
the pine tree; that’s Natalie, and it just fits her,”
and she blew a kiss from her finger tips, which
salutation Blake pretended to catch as it fluttered
by, saving it from a fall, and, more or less gracefully
conveying it by proxy to its destination—also
by blowing it from his hand. Natalie blushed
slightly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then there’s no-moh—no-moh—Oh, I can’t
remember it, Blake,” and Marie appealed to him.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No-moh-te-nah—sweeper of the tepee.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, that’s Alice. Mabel is wep-da-se-nah—maiden
of the green corn, and I’m wah-tu-go-mo—bluebird
of the mountain. All of them charming, I
think—much too nice for me, mine is.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“They all become you,” declared Jack, with an
exaggerated bow.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We’ll have to write them down or we’ll forget
them,” suggested Natalie, as she twirled the silver
ring on her finger.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And now let’s talk about camping,” suggested
Alice. “You boys—where can they go, Mabel?”
and she appealed to the young hostess.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, I like that!” cried Phil. “After all our
work—togging up like ‘Lo, the poor Indian,’ and
bringing you those names—to calmly tell us we can
leave. I guess not. We’re going to stay, and help
you arrange about your camp.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, we can do it ourselves,” declared his sister.
“We are going to be very practical Camp
Fire Girls.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, they’ll throw a whole pound of butter
away because an ant happens to get in it, and they’ll
wash dishes through two waters,” commented Jack.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why, don’t you <i>always</i> wash dishes through
two waters, when you boys go camping?” asked
Marie in surprise.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Never! When we finish a meal we put the
dishes to soak in the lake, and when we come back
the fish have them clean for us!” declared Phil.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, you boys are hopeless!” laughed Natalie.
“You must promise to reform, or you can never
come to our camp.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then you are really going to try life in the
woods?” asked Jack.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Of course!” exclaimed Marie. “Didn’t you
think we meant it?”</p>

<p class='c009'>The shaking of three heads told the story of
doubt.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, we are!” insisted Alice. “Where
would be a good place to go?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Green Lake!” answered the trio of youths as
one.</p>

<p class='c009'>“That’s because you boys have been there two
or three times,” remarked Marie.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, but really it is,” went on Blake, who, having
signaled to his chums by a series of winks,
took the leadership in the argument he hoped would
be convincing. “Green Lake is handy to get to,
there are fine woods, there is good water to drink,
plenty of camping sites, and the lake can’t be surpassed.
There are boats to hire—motors and
others—and supplies are easy to get. It’s the best
place around here to camp. We boys are going
there this summer——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Are you?” interrupted Natalie.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We are!” declared Jack. “And, if you like,
when we go up to make arrangements we’ll hire a
place for you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Shall we let them, girls?” and Alice appealed
to her chums.</p>

<p class='c009'>The girls looked at each other. Their eyes were
sparkling with the light of new resolves. They
had never gone camping though the three who had
brothers had spent a day in the latters’ tents on
the shores of Green Lake, about fifty miles away,
where the boys had, once or twice, enjoyed their
summer vacations. But for some years past, woodland
life seemed to have lost its charms. Now,
with the advent of the Camp Fire Girls organization,
it seemed likely to be revived.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Shall we?” repeated Alice.</p>

<p class='c009'>There came a tap on the door, and Mabel, going
to answer it found the maid there.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Excuse me, Miss Mabel,” she said, “but do
any of you want your fortunes told?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Our fortunes told?” echoed Mabel. “Why,
Jennie, what do you mean?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“There’s a Gypsy girl at the back door. She’s
from that encampment over near Wilson’s woods, I
guess. She asked me to inquire if there was any
one who wanted their fortune told, and as I knew
you had visitors, I thought——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Me for the Gypsy maiden!” sang out Blake.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m first!” cried Phil.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, I’m going to see what the fateful future
holds for me,” asserted Jack. “I want to see if I’m
going to pass my exams.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Boys, be quiet!” commanded Mabel. “Girls,
shall we do it—just for fun?” and she appealed
to her chums. “Of course I don’t believe anything
in it, but she may make a little diversion for us.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Just as if <i>we</i> didn’t try,” complained Blake.
“Come on, fellows, we’ll leave ’em to their own
destruction.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“If they’re going to have a fair Gypsy maiden in
I want to hear what she says,” declared Jack.</p>

<p class='c009'>“As if we would let you!” exclaimed Natalie.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Do have her, Mabel,” urged Alice. “That is if
your mother won’t object.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t believe she will. I’ll ask her. Tell the
Gypsy girl to wait, Jennie,” and Mabel hurried up
to the sitting room where Mrs. Anderson was reading.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What a lark!” exclaimed Jack. “I wonder
if she’s pretty?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“All Gypsy girls are,” declared Phil, “some
more than others.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I admire your taste,” mocked his sister.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mother says it’s all right,” announced Mabel,
hurrying back. “We’ll have her in here, and you
boys will have to behave.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Did we ever do otherwise?” demanded Phil,
pretending indignation.</p>

<p class='c009'>At the sight of the Gypsy, who followed the maid
into the library, Natalie and Mabel exchanged
glances. She was the same girl they had seen on
the street that afternoon.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Do you tell fortunes?” asked Mabel.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, lady,” and the Nomad made a bow. Then
she looked calmly at the faces of those surrounding
her. She seemed clean and neat, and even the
half-admiring, if a little too bold glances of the
boys, did not disconcert her. She was really pretty,
a fact which Marie whispered to Natalie.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Aren’t you afraid to be out so late?” went on
Mabel.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It is hardly dark yet—and who would harm
a Gypsy maiden?” was the somewhat enigmatical
answer.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What do you charge for fortunes?” asked
Mabel.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Only twenty-five cents when I go from house
to house. Though at our camp Neezar, our
Queen, charges fifty and sometimes a dollar, for a
very long fortune.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Have you really a Queen?” asked Alice.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Certainly, lady,” spoke the Gypsy, and though
her tones were a trifle coarse, her language was
more correct than that of some school girls.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I guess we’ll try the twenty-five cent fortunes,”
suggested Alice. “What is your name?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am called Hadee,” was the answer.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’ll go a dollar’s worth of fortune, Hadee,”
whispered Jack.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Be quiet,” ordered his sister.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Will you tell them out here—where we all can
listen?” asked Marie.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No indeed—I don’t want any one to hear
mine!” exclaimed Natalie, quickly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It is not done so,” explained the Gypsy.
“Each one has her own fortune—it is for herself
alone. I will not tell them in public,” and she
seemed determined.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I guess that would be better,” agreed Mabel.
“We can go, one at a time, into this little room off
the library. Who’ll be first.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Let me!” begged each of the boys.</p>

<p class='c009'>“This is only for us girls,” rebuked Alice, “you
may go practice bridge, whist, or chess.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Will you tell us your fortunes afterward?”
asked Blake.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Never—not until they come true!” laughed
Natalie.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I will tell yours first,” spoke the Gypsy, looking
at Natalie with what the others thought a strange
glance. “I can see you have much of a fortune in
your hand—and—in your face.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, how romantic! Well, I’m ready,” and
Natalie went into a small room, opening off the
library, with the Gypsy maiden.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then, through the closed door, came a murmur
of voices, but they were drowned in the excited
comments of the other three girls, while the boys
added their share.</p>

<p class='c009'>Natalie came out a little later looking rather
pale under her olive skin, but when quizzed about
it, she laughingly declared there was no cause for it,
since she had been promised a most glorious future.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You’re going to cross water, meet a dark
stranger, have a light complexioned enemy and all
that, aren’t you?” demanded Jack, banteringly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Something like that,” laughed Natalie.</p>

<p class='c009'>In turn the other girls went in and came out,
making merry over what they heard in secret.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now for us!” exclaimed Blake, when Marie,
the last of the quartette, had been told of the past,
present and future.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I tell no more!” announced the Gypsy, coming
from the room. “I am tired. If they like the gentlemen
may come to our camp to-morrow. I thank
you, ladies, but it is late, and I must be getting
back.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You may go out the front way,” suggested
Mabel gently, for, somehow, they had all taken
a liking to the pretty Gypsy stranger.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Good-night,” she said, and standing on the
front steps they all watched the Gypsy girl hurry
down the street.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Not half bad looking!” commented Jack.
“Ahem!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“She was rather a gentle little creature,” commented
his sister.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I wonder how they can stand such a life—in
wagons traveling all over?” questioned Mabel.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, she made a pretty good thing out of you
girls,” declared Phil. “Now tell us what she said.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Never!” came firmly from Natalie, and the
others echoed her words.</p>

<p class='c009'>As they went back into the library they saw Mrs.
Anderson standing at the door. Her face wore
rather a worried look.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What is it, momsey?” asked Phil. “Did you
want your fortune told?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I just happened to think,” she answered, “that
I had left my diamond ring on the table in the little
room off the library. I came down to get it,
but it isn’t there. Have you seen it, Mabel?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mother! your diamond ring?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And it was in that room that the Gypsy girl
told our fortunes.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“With the light turned low,” added Natalie.</p>

<p class='c009'>Phil brushed past his sister, and, turning up the
gas, looked carefully on the table in the little room.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No ring here, mother,” he announced. “Are
you sure you left it here?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, I was putting away some seldom-used
books, and I took it off so I would not knock it
against the shelves. Perhaps it is on the floor.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Then ensued a hurried search. It was unavailing.
The girls and boys looked at one another.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It—it’s gone!” murmured Mabel.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And so is that Gypsy girl!” echoed Phil. “I’ll
wager she has it! That’s why she didn’t want to
stop to tell us fellows our fortunes. She wanted
to get away! She had every chance in the world
to slip that ring in her pocket when she was in the
half-darkness here, telling fortunes. Fellows, come
on to that Gypsy camp, and we’ll make her give it
up!”</p>

    <div>THE DESERTED ENCAMPMENT</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>“Hadn’t we better stop and get one of the policemen?”
asked Jack, as he and his two chums
sped onward in the now full darkness of the May
evening.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, we can do what we have to do ourselves,”
declared Phil. “If they’ve got mother’s ring I’ll
take it away myself.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And she was such a pretty girl too—for a
Gypsy,” murmured Blake.</p>

<p class='c009'>“They’ll always take a trinket if they get their
hands on one,” declared Phil. “I suppose she saw
it glittering there on the table, and while she was
holding the girls’ hands, and telling them all sorts
of rubbish, she just slipped it away when they were
thinking about a dark stranger or crossing unknown
water. Bah! It makes me mad!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And she was such a pretty girl,” murmured
Blake. “I wouldn’t have believed it!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, drop that kind of talk and get a move on!”
exclaimed Phil. “It’s quite a ways out to that
Gypsy encampment, and she has a good start of
us.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Not so much,” declared Jack. “We came as
soon as your mother missed her ring.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, but we wasted five minutes talking about
where it might have strayed to, and another five
looking for our hats. That’s ten, and those Gypsies
travel light—they’re always ready to make a forced
march. Hurry up!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I still maintain that we’d better take one of
our faithful and efficient cops with us,” declared
Jack. “Those dark-skinned horse traders are
ugly customers, I’ve heard.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Not when you’ve got ’em where we have these,”
declared Phil. “They’ll wilt when we tell them
what we want, and give up.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The worst of it is that we haven’t any proof,”
suggested Blake.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No proof! I’d like to know what you call it?
Mother left her ring on the table in that little room.
The only one in it, besides our girls, was the Gypsy.
The ring is gone—the Gypsy is gone—what else
can you get from that? Things that are equal to
the same thing are equal to each other.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, I, myself, think she might have taken it,”
went on Blake, “in spite of the fact that she had a
nice face. But that isn’t proof. Suppose they say
they haven’t it—that she hasn’t it—what are you
going to do?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Phil stopped short in his quick walk toward the
outskirts of the town where the Gypsy wagons
had been drawn up for the last week.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why—er—why,” he began, “I suppose perhaps
maybe we had better take a policeman with
us. He’ll be sort of impressive, you see. Yes, I
guess we will. Wish I’d thought of it at first.
That’s more time we’re going to lose.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The boys turned back toward the more thickly
populated part of the town, in search of a guardian
of the law, of whom there were half a dozen, or
more, in Middleford.</p>

<p class='c009'>Meanwhile there was plenty of excitement at the
Anderson home. Mrs. Anderson and the girls went
carefully over the room in which the fortunes had
been told, but only to confirm the first suspicion—the
ring was gone.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Couldn’t you have left it on your dresser,
mother?” asked Mabel, with tears in her eyes.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’ve looked there. No, I distinctly remember
laying it on the table when I put away some books,”
for the little room was used as a sort of storeroom.
“Jennie called me for something or other. I meant
to come back and get my ring. But I never gave
it another thought until you asked me about the
fortune telling. Then I happened to recall that
you might go in that room, to be private, and I
came down. But the prophetess had gone,” she
finished rather pathetically.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And also your lovely diamond ring!” sobbed
Mabel. “The one papa gave you for the wedding
anniversary. Oh, it’s all my fault!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Not at all, Mabel!” exclaimed Mrs. Anderson.
“How could you know I had left my ring there?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And how could we know that Gypsy was a—thief?”
burst out Marie.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, I do hope the boys catch her!” murmured
Alice.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Will—will they be in any danger?” asked
Natalie timidly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What! Three of them to one little Gypsy girl?
I guess you don’t know our brothers!” exclaimed
Mabel.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, I never had any, you see,” responded Natalie
with a smile. “But I was thinking she might
get to where her people are, and those Gypsy men
aren’t the most gentle individuals, I’ve heard.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That’s so!” cried Alice. “Oh, I hope——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I wish father were home,” put in Mabel.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I have it!” burst out Marie. “The police!
We can telephone to them, and ask them to go and
protect the boys.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Perhaps it would be a good idea,” suggested
Mrs. Anderson. “I don’t like the fuss and notoriety,
but I do want my ring back, and I wouldn’t
like the boys to run into any danger. You had better
telephone, Mabel.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Soon the wire to the police station was in use,
with Mabel on one end and the somewhat venerable
chief on the other.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh!” gasped Mabel. “There’s been a robbery
here, Chief. Mother’s diamond ring, that
father gave her for a wedding present. It was a
lovely ring, and——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Skip all those details,” urged Alice in a low
voice. Alice could be very practical at times.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, a robbery,” went on Mabel’s voice. “At
our house. A Gypsy came to tell our fortunes—no
it’s nothing about the porch—I said fortunes—f-o-r-t-u-n-e-s—”
and she spelled it out. “A Gypsy
girl—mother’s ring was on a table. Now it is
gone—no, not the table—the ring. Oh, please do
hurry and get the boys! What? No, boys didn’t
take the ring. A Gypsy girl took it, and the boys—my
brother, and Jack Pendleton and Blake Lathrop.
We’re so afraid the Gypsy men may attack them.
You’ll send at once? Oh, thank you!”</p>

<p class='c009'>The instrument clicked as Mabel hung up the receiver,
and turned her still tearful eyes on her
mother and her chums.</p>

<p class='c009'>“There, at least the boys will be safe,” she whispered.
“But if they can only get your ring, momsey.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Never mind, dear. It might be worse. Don’t
distress yourself over it. We’ll just wait until the
boys come back. Perhaps you had better make
some coffee and sandwiches. They’ll be cold, for
it’s chilly, even if it is nearly June.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And time to go camping,” added Natalie.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mrs. Anderson looked at her daughter in some
surprise.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I haven’t told you yet, momsey,” Mabel said,
“but we Camp Fire Girls have been challenged by
the boys to go off to the woods at Green Lake, and
be real camp fire maidens. We are thinking of doing
it. Do you think we might?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’ll see. We’ll talk it over later. But now if
you’ll light the fire perhaps being busy will make
you forget this little trouble.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It isn’t a little trouble,” declared Mabel. “I
shall always feel that it was my fault if mother’s
ring is not recovered.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But you mustn’t, dear,” said Mrs. Anderson
gently, putting her arms around her daughter.
Mabel sobbed a little, and then, remembering her
guests, she regained her composure.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It won’t be as easy as this—getting a meal in
camp,” remarked Alice, as she put a match to the
gas stove.</p>

<p class='c009'>“But it will be ever so much more fun!” declared
Natalie. “Think of sitting beside the sky-blue
water, with the birds singing overhead, and
eating a meal beside a glowing camp fire.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Beautiful breath-of-the-pine-tree!” exclaimed
Marie. “That is if the camp fire doesn’t smoke.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“They almost always do—at least those I’ve seen
always did,” declared Mabel.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c009'>Phil, Blake and Jack had no trouble in persuading
one of the policemen to accompany them to the
Gypsy encampment. On the way, as they hurried
on, they told of what had occurred.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s about time something was done to them
Gypsies,” declared the officer. “They pretend to
tell fortunes—the women folks do—but it’s only
an excuse to get around to places and size ’em up,
so the men folks can come later, and pick up anything
that’s lying around loose. As for horse-trading,
they’d stick the wisest white man that ever
cinched a saddle. They can doctor old, worn-out
nags so they’ll look like racers, but the first time
you drive ’em the color runs in the rain, and their
manes and tails come unglued. I know Gypsies!
I’ll be glad of a chance to help run these out of
town!”</p>

<p class='c009'>The boys and officer hurried on. They had left
the lighted streets of the town, and were out on a
country road leading to the next village.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It isn’t far now,” remarked Phil.</p>

<p class='c009'>“They always have lots of curs around,” suggested
Jack. “I hope they don’t nip us in the
dark.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Just go right on boldly,” advised the officer.
“If a dog bites you kick it. I’ve got my club.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s too late after a dog bites you,” murmured
Blake. “And she was such a pretty girl,” he
added.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Say, you’ve got her on the brain!” complained
Phil.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, she had a pretty face—for a Gypsy,” declared
his chum.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t hear any dogs barking,” said Jack a little
later.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, and I don’t see any lights of their encampment,”
added Blake. “Fellows, I guess it’s farther
than we thought it was.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No it isn’t!” cried Phil. “It was right near
the bridge we just crossed. But I can tell you what
has happened!” he exclaimed, coming to a halt in
the dark road.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What?” asked his chums. “What’s happened?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Those Gypsies have skipped. See, there are
the embers of one of their camp fires, though they
use stoves when they want to do any real cooking.
Boys, they’ve skipped. We’re just too late. That
Gypsy girl, and her tribe, have vanished with
mother’s diamond ring!”</p>

<div class='nf-center c007'>
    <div>THE CALL OF THE CAMP</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>“How long the boys are.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, it seems an hour since they rushed out,
but it isn’t really more than half that.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, I do hope nothing has happened.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Thus spoke Marie, Alice and Natalie in turn, as
they sat with Mabel and her mother, anxiously
waiting.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I—I suppose you’ll have to tell father,” ventured
Mabel, after a pause, a catch manifesting itself
in her voice.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, dear,” replied Mrs. Anderson. “But don’t
distress yourself. It is no one’s fault. Father
would want to know.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Perhaps he can do something,” suggested
Natalie.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The police ought to be able to,” asserted Mabel
with rather fierce energy. “Oh, if I were a man
I’d get right after those thieving Gypsies, and make
them give up the ring! Why weren’t we boys?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s so much nicer to be girls,” murmured
Natalie.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t see why, even if we are girls, that we
can’t do something,” declared Alice with conviction.
Alice always loved to undertake strenuous matters,
though not always carrying them out. Still,
she meant well.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What do you mean?” asked Marie.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I mean why can’t we get on the trail of those
Gypsies, providing they have gone and left a trail.
I think trail is the right word,” she added, doubtfully.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Very proper,” admitted Natalie. “One always
has a ‘trail’ to camp.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What is this I hear about you girls going camping?”
asked Mrs. Anderson, probably to furnish a
new topic of conversation, and relieve the strain of
waiting.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, it’s just a notion,” answered Natalie.
“The boys laughed at our Camp Fire Association,
and we vowed that we could live in a tent in the
woods as well as they. It sounds nice, but—I don’t
know,” and she leaned dreamily back in her chair.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, Natalie!” exclaimed Marie. “And you
were so anxious to go!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, I am yet. Only I don’t know whether
my people will consent. It’s delightful to think
about, anyhow.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s this way, mother,” began Mabel, and she
briefly explained how the camping idea had germinated.
Then, probably to forget the unpleasant
episode of the ring, they all talked woodland
lore.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well,” remarked Phil, as he and his chums stood
with the officer, looking at the dying embers of the
Gypsy fire on the deserted site of the encampment,
“there’s nothing doing here, as Mr. Shakespeare
would say. What’s to be done?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I vote we take after ’em!” exclaimed Jack.
“They can’t have gotten far in this time. They
didn’t have the chance.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That’s right,” chimed in Blake. “Come on, fellows.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Wait a minute, boys,” advised the officer. “It’s
a dark night, and there are several roads branching
off this one. The Gypsies could take either one.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But we could inquire,” exclaimed Phil. “A
Gypsy caravan of that size couldn’t go along without
attracting attention, even from sleepy farmers.
They could tell if it had passed by, and if we got
on some wrong branch road, we could easily get
back on the main one, and pick up the trail.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That sounds good to me!” declared Blake.
“I’m ready for a fracas.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Same here,” came from Jack. “Say, I’m glad
I didn’t let her tell my fortune. She might have
taken my watch while she told me a pretty girl
across the water was waiting for me to write to
her.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, what do you think you are—a lady-killer?”
demanded Phil. “If we’re going to do anything
let’s do it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“How one can be deceived,” murmured Blake.
“And she such a pretty girl. She looked something
like Natalie.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Dry up!” commanded Jack shortly. “You’ve
got Natalie on the brain. Come on!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I wouldn’t, boys,” advised the officer. “It’s
dark, there are any number of roads the tribe could
have taken, not to say of slipping off into the
woods.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That’s right,” agreed Blake. “We didn’t think
of that.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And making inquiries, and then doubling back
in case you’re on the wrong road, all takes time,”
went on the policeman. “You had much better
wait until morning.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I guess that’s right,” assented Phil. “Poor
momsey will be wild about her ring, though. Well,
back home it is,” and he turned away from the deserted
encampment.</p>

<p class='c009'>They had not gone far on the backward trail ere
they heard the tramp of approaching feet on the
hard highway, for they were not yet in the district
of sidewalks.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Some one’s coming!” exclaimed Phil.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It walks like the Chief,” commented Officer
Brady.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Who’s there?” demanded a sharp voice from
the darkness.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It <i>is</i> the Chief!” the policeman asserted. “It’s
Brady, sir,” he added, in answer to a question.
“I’ve been out chasin’ after a band of Gypsies.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ha! I’m after the same tribe I guess. Have
you seen anything of young Anderson—Blake Lathrop
or Jack Pendleton, Brady?” asked the head
of the police force.</p>

<p class='c009'>“They’re here with me, sir.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ah! Their folks just telephoned to me about
them. Got worried I guess.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That’s some of the girls’ work,” was Jack’s
whispered opinion.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Did you get the ring?” demanded the Chief.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, sir. They’d skipped out.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I thought so. Well, it’s too late to do anything
to-night. Come back to the station, and we’ll send
out a telephone alarm. Anderson!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, Chief.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Can you describe your mother’s ring?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Sure.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then come along with me and I’ll write it
down so as to have it when I send out the alarm.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then we’ll get back to your house, Phil,” suggested
Blake. “We’ll tell your mother and sister
about it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“All right. I’ll come as soon as I can.”</p>

<p class='c009'>It needed but a look at the faces of the two lads,
as they entered the house a little later, to tell the
four girls, and Mrs. Anderson, that their errand
had been fruitless.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh mother!” cried Mabel. “It’s all my
fault!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Nonsense!” declared her mother, though there
was a dull ache in her heart at the loss of her beautiful
ring.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We’re going to get on their trail the first thing
in the morning!” declared Jack fiercely. “They
can’t get far away—a Gypsy tribe is too conspicuous
to hide away very long.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The boys told of their chase, and explained Phil’s
absence, though before they had finished he came
in. Then it all had to be gone over with again, so
that it was quite late when the five left Mabel’s
house.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Wo-he-lo!” chorused Alice, Natalie and Marie,
as they waved good-night to Mabel and Phil.
“Wo-he-lo!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What’s that?” demanded Jack, rather surprised
at the musical intonation of his sister and
her two chums.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The call of our camp,” explained Natalie.
“It is made up of the first two letters of the
words—work—health—love. Isn’t it pretty?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Love?” asked Blake mischievously.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Silly!” murmured Natalie.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Say it again,” demanded Jack.</p>

      <div class='line'>Ho! Ho!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Thus chanted Marie.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Bravo!” complimented Jack. “That will do
as a war-whoop to scare the Gypsies—when we find
them,” he added more soberly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“See you at the Academy to-morrow,” called
Mabel, as she and her mother and brother went off
the steps.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Wo-he-lo!” gurgled Natalie deep in her throat.
She was half Indian, some of her friends used to
say, and they often called her Pocahontas. “Wo-he-lo!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The call of the camp,” murmured Jack. “I
wonder if they really will go off to the woods?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“We’d have no end of good times if they did,”
replied his chum in a low voice. “We could camp
near them, go on picnics, off rowing, in a motor——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don’t count too much,” interrupted Jack.
“Girls are finicky creatures. They may change
their minds half a dozen times before vacation.”</p>

<p class='c009'>As Natalie’s home was not much out of their
way, Jack and Marie went in that direction with
her, Blake and Alice going part of the distance.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We’ll get on the trail of the false but beautiful
Gypsy girl after class to-morrow,” called Blake
to Jack, as they parted.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Sure thing. Good-night!”</p>

    <div>OFF TO THE WOODS</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>“Aren’t they just too dear for anything?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And such an artistic color!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That olive brown is so becoming to you,
Natalie.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, I think it suits all of you as well!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Do let your hair down in those two long braids,
Natalie, and be Pocahontas,” urged Mabel. “It is
so becoming to you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But it’s so hard to arrange afterward,” laughed
breath-of-the-pine-tree.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, it hardly seems possible that we really can
go off to the woods!” sighed Marie.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And camp—just as the boys do—in a tent and
not in a stupid hotel, or boarding house,” added
Alice.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And do our own cooking,” came from Mabel.
“I do hope the oil stove won’t explode—or do
whatever oil stoves ought not to do.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don’t suggest it!” cried Natalie. “We don’t
want to think of the unpleasant features. Think of
the birds, and the green trees, and the land of the
sky-blue water and——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Natalie doesn’t like to think of unpleasant
things,” mocked Marie.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why should one, when there is so much that is
beautiful and pleasant in the world?” demanded the
olive-tinted one.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Spoken like a true Camp Fire Girl!” exclaimed
Alice. “Say, I do believe my middy-blouse is too
small for me,” and she tried to get a view of her
back in the glass, by twisting her neck around much
after the manner of an ostrich.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And they’re sure to shrink when they’re
washed,” declared Marie.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don’t speak of it,” begged Marie. “Mine is
tight under the arms, too.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then let’s not wash them!” suggested Natalie
with a brilliant thought. “There won’t be much
chance in camp, anyhow.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The four girls were at Marie’s house, where they
seemed to assemble more often than any other
place. The semi-Indian suits, consisting of khaki
skirts and middy-blouses of the same material had
just been received from the headquarters of the
Camp Fire Girls, and our friends were trying them
on with varying degrees of satisfaction. Truly the
costumes, simple and serviceable as they were,
seemed becoming in the extreme.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We won’t be afraid of climbing over rocks,
stumps and tree trunks with these boots,” went on
Marie, as she inspected the shoes that had come
with the outfits.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And we can sit down on the grass without a
qualm,” added Mabel. “Oh, I wish we could always
dress like this.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Even at a dance?” asked Natalie.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, maybe not at a dance,” conceded Mabel,
thinking of a “perfect dream” of a dress she had.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Isn’t it too bad Cora and Gertrude can’t go with
us?” spoke Marie, as she daintily powdered her
nose.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, and Margaret, Sadie and Edna were wild
to be with us when they heard about it, but they
could not manage,” went on Alice referring to
other members of the Camp Fire organization.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was about two weeks after the loss of Mrs.
Anderson’s ring. In the meanwhile, though a careful
search had been made, no trace of it, nor of the
Gypsy band had been found. The tribe seemed
to have disappeared, which was not strange, as that
region consisted of many little-explored patches of
woodland, in which many bands might have hidden.
The police of several towns could not trace the
nomads.</p>

<p class='c009'>True a tribe had been located soon after the dramatic
episode of the fortune-telling, but they asserted
they had not been near Middleford on the
night in question, and neither the boys nor girls
could pick out from amid the members of the band,
Hadee, the pretty girl who had visited Mabel’s
house.</p>

<p class='c009'>“None of these Gypsy maidens were as pretty as
she was,” declared Blake.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You seem to have lost your heart to her,” commented
Natalie.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Not yet,” he said in a low voice.</p>

<p class='c009'>And so Mrs. Anderson’s ring was given up—though
the boys said the tribe was sure to return the
next spring, since the Gypsies always made the
same rounds year after year.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And when they do come here we’ll have them
pinched!” declared Phil.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, such slang!” gasped his sister.</p>

<p class='c009'>“They’ll never come back here if they really
have that ring,” was Blake’s opinion—one that was
shared by others.</p>

<p class='c009'>But the matter of going camping to Green Lake
had, in a measure, taken the edge off the sorrow
felt over Mrs. Anderson’s loss—at least on the part
of the four girls.</p>

<p class='c009'>They had arranged, through the Camp Fire
Guardian, Mrs. Bonnell, to get their suits, and then
they seriously began to consider the matter of going
camping. After some consideration the respective
parents of the pretty quartette had consented, especially
since Mrs. Bonnell was to be with them,
and she had often gone to the woods with her late
husband, though she frankly admitted that she
knew very little about practical woodlore.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, but that’s all the better!” exclaimed Natalie.
“We can learn for ourselves, and if we do
make mistakes, we won’t repeat them. It will be
jolly fun!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And if we get into real difficulties the boys
won’t be so very far away,” added practical Alice,
for Jack and his chums had followed up the idea,
casually expressed, and had decided to spend their
vacation on the shores of Green Lake. Perhaps
this is one reason why the parents of the girls had
consented to the young ladies roughing it for a
time, since three well-developed brothers might well
look after three sisters, and a brotherless girl into
the bargain.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We’ll each share a third of a brother with you,
Nat,” offered Mabel.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Which is very kind of you, maiden-of-the-green-corn,”
replied the breath-of-the-pine-tree,
with a laugh that showed her white, even teeth.</p>

<p class='c009'>There was much to do. Fortunately the academy
where the boys and girls attended, closed two weeks
earlier that term to allow of extensive repairs to
be made to the building, so that it was possible to
spend part of the rare month of June in the woods.</p>

<p class='c009'>For the boys, who had often gone camping, it
was not so difficult, but to the girls the work of arranging
for tents, cots, a camping site, the necessary
cooking utensils, an oil stove, and seeing
about other matters came rather hard.</p>

<p class='c009'>“A camp fire is all right,” declared Jack, when
he had been appealed to, “and probably you’ll want
one every night, to sit about and talk, but for cooking,
unless you have to—nix! The smoke gets into
your eyes, no matter which side of it you get on,
and in rainy weather it’s out of the question.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I know it can be used, and I’ve gotten up a
dinner of six courses on an open fire, with two
stones for the sides and a sheet of iron for the top,
but if you don’t want to spend all your time feeling
and smelling like a smoked ham, take an oil stove.
It’s not so romantic, but you’ll have time for more
real romance with it for you’ll have more time for
the woods and water.”</p>

<p class='c009'>And the girls had followed his advice, in which
the other boys concurred. Then came the matter of
arranging for the camping-site, which they hired
from a man who owned considerable property on
the shores of the lake—the same man from whom
the boys engaged their location.</p>

<p class='c009'>The two camps would be about a quarter of a
mile apart, and, as the lake shore curved, and as the
boys had a small dock built out on a point of land,
they could view the girls’ tents from that vantage-place—or
they would be able to when the tents were
erected.</p>

<p class='c009'>The task of arranging for tents for the girls, one
to cook in and another as sleeping quarters had
been rendered more easy from the fact that a party
of young people who made a practice of going to
the lake did not intend to do so this season. They
advertised their outfit for hire, and, on the advice
of the boys, Natalie and her chums took it.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We know that camp,” declared Jack. “There’s
a good board floor for both tents, and, though you
may want a few things, you will find almost everything
you need. It’s a rare chance.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And we’ll help you put up the tents,” added
Blake. “We’ll go up the same day you do.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Thank you, but please let us do all we can for
ourselves,” suggested Mabel. “We want to be real
Camp Fire Girls, and put up our own tents. It
isn’t so hard; is it?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Not when you get the knack of it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then we’ll read about it in some book. I wonder
if the encyclopædia has anything about tents in
it,” mused Alice, for, as usual the young people had
gathered at Marie’s house.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I can show you in two minutes, better than any
book,” declared Phil. “This is how you want to
start,” and then, with a napkin, some string and a
couple of knives and forks he proceeded to illustrate
the not always easy task of setting a wall tent.</p>

<p class='c009'>The girls thought they understood it. Then came
other advice about settling the camp, how to arrange
the stores, what to buy, how to put up the
cots, distribute the blankets, put up the fly, to keep
out both sun and rain, and many other details.</p>

<p class='c009'>In the days that followed—and busy ones they
were—the girls completed their arrangements.
They wrote on ahead for a supply of food that
could be kept in stock, and were glad to learn that
a not too distant lake-shore village would supply
them when needed, a butcher and grocer coming
around in a boat to take orders, for Green Lake
was a favorite camping-site for many.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And we start to-morrow!” exclaimed Mabel,
as she and her chums had gathered at her house for
a last consultation.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, isn’t it glorious!” cried Natalie. “I’m
just dying to roam through the woods in that
Indian costume.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Be careful some modern brave doesn’t run
away with you,” cautioned Alice.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’d like to see him,” asserted Natalie.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You won’t; he’ll probably capture you after
dark,” challenged Mabel.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I wonder where I put it!” suddenly exclaimed
Alice, as she began searching among a miscellaneous
collection of articles on the bureau, where
the girls had piled a number of purchases.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What are you looking for?” asked Mabel.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m obeying the first law of the Camp Fire
Girls,” was the answer.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What’s that?” inquired Natalie.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Seeking beauty—I bought a tube of cold cream,
and now I can’t find it. I do burn so terribly when
first I go out in the summer sun. Where is that
cold cream?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Vanity of vanities!” quoted Mabel.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Didn’t you get some yourself—hypocrite!” declaimed
Alice.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I did,” confessed her accuser.</p>

<p class='c009'>“So did I,” admitted Marie.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Natalie doesn’t need it,” went on Alice, as she
found her tube, besides a little vanity box containing
a tiny pad of wool and—well they all carried
the same thing. Rice powder they asserted the box
contained.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I suppose the boys will be there waiting for us,”
suggested Marie.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes,” assented Alice. “But I do wish they’d
let us do all we can for ourselves. It’s no fun to
have everything done for you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Again the true Camp Fire Girl speaketh!”
murmured Natalie. “I rather imagine we’ll find
enough to do.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Did you ask the man to have all our things at
the place where the tent is to go up?” asked Mabel.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes,” asserted Alice, “and he promised. Also
to see that our ‘grub’ as I believe the camp-term
for dinner is, was on hand. He said the tent platforms
would be laid, and all we would have to do
would be to put up the tents and cots. I guess it
will be easy.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Easy is as easy does,” misquoted Marie. “Oh,
we must make sure that Mrs. Bonnell has everything
she wants. Let’s go over and talk with her
now. There is always so much to do at the last
minute.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Behold then, the next morning, four eager Camp
Fire Girls with the pink tint of excitement in their
cheeks, assembled at the station of the railroad that
was to take them to Green Lake. They had their
suit cases, trunks having been sent on ahead with
bed clothing and other necessities. They also had
a miscellaneous collection of boxes and bundles—things
that they had forgotten until the last minute.</p>

<p class='c009'>“But isn’t it a glorious day!” cried Natalie, as
she waltzed around the platform with Marie as a
partner.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Most glorious!” agreed Alice. “Oh, here
comes our train, and I know I’ve forgotten to put
in my tennis slippers to use in the canoe!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Too late now,” decided the Guardian. “You
can write for them. Now, girls, we’ll try to get
seats together.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Then the train steamed in, they hurried aboard,
amid many admiring glances from other passengers,
and soon they were on their way to the camp in the
woods.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Wo-he-lo!” sang Natalie softly, as the train
gathered speed. “Wo-he-lo!”</p>

    <div>THE OLD MAN</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>“That rope should go the other way!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, I remember Jack saying you should fasten
the other rope first.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Are you sure the pegs are driven in tightly
enough?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“There! I knew something would be missing.
We haven’t a hammer to drive in the pegs with.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But where are the tent pegs?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Thus the girls questioned and commented as they
had gathered about an indiscriminate collection of
canvas, boards, ropes and other things at the campsite
on Green Lake. They had made a quick trip
in the train, and the little lake steamer had landed
them at Crystal Springs, as their camping-ground
was called.</p>

<p class='c009'>“There are the pegs,” said Alice, after a look
about, and she indicated some articles that looked
like exaggerated clothes pins, save for the slot.</p>

<p class='c009'>“That’s so, we must decide where they are to go,
and drive them in, so we’ll have something to fasten
the ropes to,” declared Natalie. “I remember
Blake saying that.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But no hammer!” cried Marie.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Use a stone, girls,” suggested Mrs. Bonnell.
“There are plenty hereabouts. Then we must set
up the oil stove and make tea. I’m famished for
some.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I hope the man left oil,” murmured Alice.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, here’s some in a can,” called Mabel, who
was looking about. “And the stove is just like one
we have.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Girls!” called the Guardian, “just slip your
middy-blouses over your waists, and put on the
skirts too. You can work so much better then, and
not be afraid of soiling anything.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The change was quickly made, the girls having
brought in their suit cases their Camp Fire garments.
Then they began once more to try to solve
the problem of the tent. But it was not so easy as
they had supposed, even with the help of a diagram
Marie had made from Jack’s vivid description.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, dear!” sighed Alice. “I wish the boys
were here after all. One never knows how much
one needs them until they are not on hand.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, we can do it!” asserted Mabel. “Let’s
try the small cooking tent first. That will be
easier.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why didn’t we think of that?” asked Alice.
“We can use it as a sort of model. Come, girls.
Wo-he-lo!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“If you shout like that some will surely hear,
and come to help us,” said Marie. “I wonder where
the boys are?” and she looked toward the point of
land, where a waving flag denoted the presence of
the camp of their brothers. But the boys were not
in evidence.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Probably they did not know just when we
would arrive,” suggested Mrs. Bonnell, as she
helped Natalie lay out the smaller tent.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s just as well—if we can get the tent up
alone,” spoke Mabel. “So much the more credit
for us. But it does look like one of those Chinese
puzzles,” she went on rather hopelessly. By dint
of much changing and shifting, trying first one
rope then another, turning the pile of canvas first
this way and that the girls finally, with the help of
Mrs. Bonnell, got it in such a position that, after
a sort of council of war they decided that they
could erect it.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now, all together!” called the Guardian of the
Camp Fire Girls. “Raise it up, Mabel and Marie,
while Natalie and Alice fasten the ropes to the
pegs.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The three of them raised, while two excited
girls, on either side, took the trailing side ropes and
began to catch them around the notched pegs, that
had, with much labor, been driven into the earth
with stones.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now let go!” ordered Mrs. Bonnell.</p>

<p class='c009'>The girls stepped back.</p>

<p class='c009'>The tent came down with a dismal flop.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, dear!” sighed Natalie.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Isn’t it a shame! Just when we had it nearly
up?” spoke Alice.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, we’ll have to do it all over again,” decided
the Guardian. “But we have the right idea
now.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t believe Natalie and Alice put the ropes
on the pegs quickly enough,” declared Mabel.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, we did so!” chorused the two.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then why should it come down?” demanded
Marie, as if the question was unanswerable.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t know,” declared Natalie. “I know I
bruised my knuckles on that one peg. Where is your
cold cream, Alice? I left mine in my suit case, and
it’s so hard to open.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“This is no time for cold cream—nor ice cream,
either!” declared Alice. “Let’s try once more.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“’Twon’t do you a bit of good ladies!” suddenly
exclaimed a voice from the lake shore. “You can
work ’till doomsday tryin’ t’ git a tent up that way,
but lessen you puts th’ ridge pole on top of th’
end poles, an’ raises them fust, you won’t never
git no tent up.”</p>

<p class='c009'>They looked whence the voice came and saw an
old man, in a clumsy rowboat, regarding them with
half-quizzical, half-amused glances.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The poles!” murmured Natalie.</p>

<p class='c009'>“That’s why the tent wouldn’t stay up!” added
Marie.</p>

<p class='c009'>“How silly of us!” chorused Alice and Mabel.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Goin’ t’ camp here?” asked the old man.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We—we hoped to,” answered Mrs. Bonnell.
“But if we don’t know enough to put up a small
tent I don’t see——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’ll help you,” volunteered the visitor. “I
often help camping parties that don’t know much
about the game. I’ll help you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“We’re Camp Fire Girls!” declared Mabel with
dignity.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ha! Ha!” chuckled the old man. “I have
seen folks what could git up a good meal over a
camp fire, but they was mighty few. I see you’ve
brought an oil stove. That’s what they mostly does
up here. There’s some fellows over on Stony Point
that have got their camp going in good shape.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“They are our brothers,” said Mabel.</p>

<p class='c009'>“So! Wa’al, now let’s see about your tent,” and
he lumbered up from his boat which he tied to a
stump on shore. “Have you got poles?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c009'>“They are over there,” replied Mrs. Bonnell,
rather put out at her own inability to recall that her
husband had, several times, had her help him erect
their tent.</p>

<p class='c009'>“That’s good. Now I’ll show you. I guess between
us we can manage to raise the tents.”</p>

<p class='c009'>As he spoke he came face to face with Natalie
who had gone for some cold cream to apply to her
bruised knuckles. At the sight of breath-of-the-pine-tree
the old man started back, and a queer
look came over his face. Staring at Natalie he exclaimed
in a whisper:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Who—who are you? Have—have you come
back to me?”</p>

<div class='chapter'>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c007'>
    <div>A NIGHT ALARM</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Instinctively the four girls, and Mrs. Bonnell,
drew nearer together, shrinking away from the old
man who had come up out of his boat to help them
erect the tents. On his part he remained staring at
Natalie, as though she were some ghost from the
past. She paled a little beneath her clear, olive skin,
but she did not seem afraid:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Who are you?” repeated the man. “Surely
you are not <i>her</i> come back to me after all these
years. No, no! It can’t be, and yet you have her
face—Speak—tell me!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What do you mean?” demanded Mrs. Bonnell,
gathering her wits that had been a bit scattered by
the suddenness of the change of manner in the man.
“Who are you?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Everybody about here knows me,” he answered,
not taking his eyes off Natalie, yet advancing no
farther toward her. “But she—who is she?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“One of the Camp Fire Girls, to be sure!”
broke in Alice, with an attempt at gaiety. “What
is this all about? It’s like amateur theatricals.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“He seems to have taken quite a fancy to
Natalie,” remarked Mabel, in a low voice.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You can’t blame him,” whispered Marie.
“She’s the dearest girl!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am afraid you have made a mistake,” said
careful Mrs. Bonnell, somewhat stiffly. “None of
us ever saw you before, as far as we know. We
have never been here before, and, though you may
be well known here, we haven’t the honor of your
acquaintance. Please don’t annoy my girls.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I beg pardon,” the man mumbled. “I didn’t
go for to make any trouble, that’s sure. I’m
Hanson Rossmore—Old Hanson they mostly calls
me hereabouts. I ask your pardon, ladies, but she
did look wondrous like—well, what’s the use of
mentioning it now. It’s past and gone years ago—years
ago. Only—with her hair down her back
like an Indian maid she fair did remind me of—Oh,
well, will you let me help you put up your
tents?” he finished rather gruffly, and he seemed
ashamed of the emotion he had displayed.</p>

<p class='c009'>Natalie, whose exertion in trying to help with the
tents had brought her glorious hair, in the two
heavy braids, drooping down her back, looked relieved,
and gazed somewhat wonderingly at the
old fellow, as, indeed, did the others.</p>

<p class='c009'>He, however, seemed to have forgotten his queer
words, and, striding to the jumbled pile of canvas,
he began straightening it out, muttering the while
to himself.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What do you suppose he meant?” whispered
Marie to Mrs. Bonnell.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I think he mistook Natalie for some one he
knew, or thought he knew,” the Guardian replied.
“He looks to me as though he were not quite right
mentally.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, don’t say that, Mrs. Bonnell!” exclaimed
Mabel in a hoarse whisper.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Hush! He’ll hear you,” cautioned Alice. “Besides
I think he looks harmless, and we do need
some one to help us, or we’ll have to sleep under a
tree to-night.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Never!” breathed Natalie. “I’ll go back home
first.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Can’t!” declared Mabel sententiously. “The
last train is gone. It’s Green Lake for ours to-night
anyhow.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, we’ll be all right as soon as we get up the
tent,” declared Alice. “I never knew a tent could
tangle so. I don’t see where the boys are. They
ought to be here to help us.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I believe we did mention something about being
independent, and wanting to do things without
their help, just to show them that we could,”
murmured Natalie softly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I wonder, oh, I wonder if that be sarcasm?”
whispered Marie, and they all joined in the laugh
that followed.</p>

<p class='c009'>Old Hanson looked up with a grin on his
weather-wrinkled face.</p>

<p class='c009'>“That laughter sounds good,” he muttered.
“Everybody feels happier when they come to Green
Lake.”</p>

<p class='c009'>He seemed himself again, a simple countryman,
though the others noticed that he glanced at Natalie
furtively from time to time, as he straightened out
the tangle of the tent ropes.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m sure we’ll all feel better when we get our
shelter up, and have a camp fire built,” said Alice.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, girls, but it’s going to be lovely here when
we <i>do</i> get straightened out!” declared Mabel, as
she gazed up into the tangle of green in the trees
overhead.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Wo-he-lo—Dogwood Camp Fire!” echoed
Natalie, with a trill to her deep, rich contralto
voice.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Is that your college yell?” asked Old Hanson.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes,” replied Mrs. Bonnell, not wishing him to
get too familiar with her pretty charges. “Can we
help you raise the tent now?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“In jest a minute, lady. As soon as I lay out the
poles and spread the canvas over ’em.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, those poles!” exclaimed Alice. “Wasn’t
it stupid of us not to remember that a tent had to
have poles?”</p>

<p class='c009'>They watched the old man take the ridge pole and
fit the holes in either end of it, over the pins on
the tops of the two end poles. Then he spread the
canvas over the ridge pole, bringing the central
seam of it along the stick. Next he laid out the
two side walls of the tent, with the guy ropes trailing
off, the middle one on each side being placed
near stakes that had been temporarily driven in the
ground. Old Hanson then drove a stake in front
and one to the rear of the tent, trailing the ropes
from the end poles off toward them.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now, ladies,” he said, in rather brisk business-like
tones, “if some of you will manage one end
pole, I’ll tackle the other. Then two of you mind
the pole ropes, one to each, and pull them as tight
as you can around the stakes. I’ll tighten ’em more
later.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Mrs. Bonnell, Alice and Marie, stationed themselves
at the front pole, while Old Hanson looked
after the other. Natalie took the front rope, and
Mabel the rear.</p>

<p class='c009'>“All ready!” called the volunteer helper.
“Raise!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Lifting the end poles raised the top or ridge one,
and the tent went with it, hanging down, as Marie
said, “like a sheet on a line.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now fasten the end ropes!” called Mr. Rossmore.
“Any way so’s they’ll hold.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Natalie and Mabel did their best, and soon the
tent was partly stayed. Then, while the end poles
were still held from toppling over sideways, under
the direction of Old Hanson they secured the two
middle side ropes to the pegs.</p>

<p class='c009'>“There!” cried their helper, letting go of the
pole. “She’ll hold until we can peg her down. It
will be easy now.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Rapidly the other side pegs were put in, the ropes
tauted on them, and the tent was up. It only remained
to further stretch the front and rear guy
ropes, and fasten the sides of the canvas down to
the wooden platform. It took some time to do this,
and longer to put up the other tent, but finally it
was accomplished.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now I’ll help you put your trunks in,” offered
Mr. Rossmore. “We can put up the flies on to-morrow.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Flies!” exclaimed Natalie. “I guess he means
fly paper; doesn’t he? Though I hoped we wouldn’t
be bothered with insects up here.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The ‘fly’ of a tent is a piece of extra canvas
that goes over the top like a roof,” explained Mrs.
Bonnell. “It keeps out hard rain. The boys will
help us put them on,” she added to the old man.
“But we will be glad to have you help us lift in the
trunks,” for the girls’ baggage had been left at a
dock near their camp by an early morning steamer,
previous to their arrival.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, to get off some of my things!” cried Alice,
when they were in the privacy of the dressing tent,
and Old Hanson had been thankfully dismissed with
a dollar, handed him by Mrs. Bonnell, to pay him
for his work. “I’m nearly dead with this Camp
Fire outfit on over my other clothes.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“So am I!” confessed Natalie. “Oh, isn’t it
lovely to be free, and not to have to primp before
a glass.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Speaking of glasses, I wonder if we brought
one,” asked Mabel.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I did!” came in a chorus from the other three
girls.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And to a camp!” reproached Mrs. Bonnell with
a laugh.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Rule number one—seek beauty!” quoted
Natalie.</p>

<p class='c009'>“She who needs it least,” murmured Alice.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No compliments—leave them for the boys—if
we ever see them again,” warned Marie.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m famished!” declared Mabel. “Can’t we
have a cup of tea?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’ll light the oil stove and make it,” volunteered
the practical Marie. “But some one ought to look
after the cots.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“We’ll do that—only give us tea!” begged
Natalie, and soon five cots, with the accompanying
bedclothes, stood neatly arranged about the walls
of the larger tent, while all around were the trunks
and suit cases, with a more or less indiscriminate
collection of garments leading into and out of them.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Never mind!” consoled Mrs. Bonnell, as she
saw the girls’ looks of dismay at the upset condition,
“we can take all day to-morrow to straighten
out. To-night we must get some supper and rest,
and it’s getting late.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, for the glorious camp fire!” cried Alice.
“We must have a big one in honor of our arrival!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Not too large,” remarked the cautious Guardian.
“We must remember that we are in the
woods, and there isn’t an alarm box on every tree.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Merrily they sat about the table—some boards
over saw horses, the same that the former campers
had used.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We’ll put oilcloth on to-morrow,” promised
Marie, as she “poured” while the others acted as
“floaters”, as Natalie laughingly expressed it.</p>

<p class='c009'>Fortunately for the girls, who had never gone
camping before, there were no hitches after that
one about the tents. All their baggage had arrived,
which is not always the case in summer outings, the
camp paraphernalia was on hand, including the
food-stuff they had ordered. The outfit they had
hired was particularly well equipped as to cooking
utensils, and the man who brought them from the
place where they had been stored, seemed to have
forgotten nothing. There was even condensed milk
for the tea, and sugar for those who wished it.
The oil stove burned well, and this was a blessing.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No dish-washing to-night!” exclaimed Marie,
when some one proposed it. “We’re all too dead
tired. We’ll have enough for breakfast. After
that we’ll make out a schedule, and get down to a
system.”</p>

<p class='c009'>It was now drawing on toward dusk, but the
June evenings were so long, that even after the sun
was out of sight it would be light enough to see
to go about.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Wood gatherers this way!” called Natalie,
when they arose from the dining table, which had
been set under a canvas shelter between the two
tents. “Ho, wood-gatherers! Let us see if we are
worthy of the name!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Wo-he-lo!” warbled Marie.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Dogwood Camp Fire!” echoed Mabel.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Remember, not too big a blaze,” cautioned Mrs.
Bonnell, as the four set about gathering fagots
and bits of dry bark for the fire.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We ought to have a camp kettle boiling on a
tripod over the flames, as the Gypsies do,” suggested
Marie, when they had collected a pile of
fuel.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don’t say Gypsy to me!” cried Mabel.
“Every time I hear the word I nearly cry, thinking
of poor mother’s ring.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Perhaps you’ll get it back some day,” suggested
Alice.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Never!” declared Mabel. “But don’t think
about it. I wonder where the boys are?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Who’ll light the fire?” asked Natalie, when the
pile was ready for the match.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Let Mrs. Bonnell have the honor,” suggested
Marie, and to the Guardian it went.</p>

<p class='c009'>The girls did not speak as the tiny flame caught
the wood, and began mounting upward until the
yellow tongues were playing in and out among the
fagots. Silently the Camp Fire Girls sat on the
mossy ground about their vestal flame, thinking of
many things.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Isn’t it beautiful,” whispered Natalie.</p>

<p class='c009'>“So peaceful,” added Marie.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And such a sweet odor—like incense,” murmured
Mabel.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s just lovely,” came from Alice. “It’s too
beautiful to go to bed, and there’s going to be a
moon, too. I can see it—a new moon.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Look at it over your left shoulder and wish,”
advised Marie.</p>

<p class='c009'>“For the boys,” added Mabel.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t see—” began Natalie, when the woods
echoed to a weird yell.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh!” screamed all the girls at once, and even
Mrs. Bonnell clutched the arm of Mabel who was
next to her.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The boys are here, O maidens of the camp
fire!” came in hollow tones from the ring of darkness
surrounding the blaze. “Answer to your
names!”</p>

<p class='c009'>And some one called:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Wa-tu-go-mo!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Here,” answered Marie, with a sigh of relief.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Wep-da-se-nah!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Present,” murmured Mabel.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No-moh-te-nah!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Dead tired,” laughed Alice.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Chee-ne-sagoo!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The breath of the pine tree calls me to slumber,”
answered Natalie.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Quite poetical,” complimented the voice of
Blake Lathrop.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And, last but not least, ‘Guardian-of-the-pretty-maidens’!”
went on the voice calling the roll.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Guilty!” answered Mrs. Bonnell, with a laugh.
“Come on out, boys, and explain why you weren’t
here when you were most needed. We came near
never getting our tents up, because we forgot to put
the poles under, and couldn’t understand why they
toppled down.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That’s a good one!” cried Jack, as he and the
others emerged from the shadows into the light of
the first camp fire.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Where were you?” demanded Alice of her
brother.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We went down to meet you,” he replied. “We
couldn’t understand why you didn’t come. We
waited until the last boat, and then gave you up.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And we here all the while!” cried Marie. “Oh,
you boys! Didn’t I tell you we would come on the
first afternoon boat?” she demanded of Jack.</p>

<p class='c009'>“If you did I guess I lost the letter,” he confessed.
“We’ve had a time getting our own camp
in shape. Those fellows forgot half the stuff I told
them to order.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“We didn’t forget any more than you did,” retorted
Phil.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Let us have peace,” urged Blake. “At last we
are here, and the girls are safe.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No thanks to you, though,” remarked Alice
a trifle sharply. “We had help, however.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Who?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“A man?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I demand his name!” cried Blake, in mock
heroics.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I think he called himself Mr. Rossmore,” answered
Natalie.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, Old Hanson,” said Jack. “Yes, he’s quite
a character around here.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What is his secret?” asked Mrs. Bonnell. “He
stared at Natalie in the queerest way, and asked her
if she had come back to him after all these years,
and all sorts of nonsense like that.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Scared you; did he?” inquired Phil.</p>

<p class='c009'>“A little, yes,” admitted Alice. “What is the
matter with him?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, disappointed in love when he was young—same
as I’ve been half a dozen times,” put in Blake.
“His sweetheart died, or ran away with some one
else I believe. He lives all alone in a haunted mill
not far away, and——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Rats!” cried Jack. “Nothing of the sort.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s getting shivery,” murmured Alice.
“Haunted mills—and hermits——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Do tell us about it!” begged Natalie.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Blake has it all twisted,” declared Phil. “Old
Hanson does live in a deserted mill somewhere back
of here, but it was his daughter who ran away—not
his sweetheart. And it was years ago. He’s a
little crazy I guess, and sometimes he imagines
strangers do look like her. But he’s harmless.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Perfectly so,” chimed in Jack. “He often
helps us around camp, when we’re too lazy to work.
And he’s the best fisherman for miles around.
Knows where all the big bass are.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But is the mill really haunted?” demanded
Natalie.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Stop, Nat!” commanded Alice. “Do you want
us all to have bad dreams to-night?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It looks old enough, and deserted enough, to be
haunted,” went on Blake, “though of course it
isn’t. We’ll go over and see it sometime.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“In broad daylight,” stipulated Marie, and the
boys laughed.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then the girls told of how they had been helped
by the aged man, and how they had made camp
after a fashion. In turn the boys related how they
had gone to the end of the lake, where the trains
came in, to meet their sisters, but had evidently
made a mistake in the time.</p>

<p class='c009'>“But we’re all here now, and ready for glorious
fun,” added Mrs. Bonnell. “We expect you young
gentlemen to give whatever aid is needed in time of
trouble.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Call on us whenever you need us,” urged Blake.
“Give your camp cry, or fire three shots from a
revolver——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh!” screamed Marie. “Don’t mention those
horrid pistols again!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What! Haven’t you a gun?” asked Blake, and
he seemed in earnest.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Look!” cried Mrs. Bonnell dramatically, and
she held out something on which the firelight
gleamed.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Put it away! Put it away!” murmured Alice,
covering her face with her hands.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s only an ammonia squirt-gun,” explained the
Guardian, with a merry laugh. “I saw them
advertised and bought one. They are good for man
or beast, the paper said. It’s just a rubber bulb on a
sort of hollow lead tube. You press the bulb and
the ammonia spurts out.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Good!” exclaimed Jack. “I don’t know that
you could have anything better. Still, if you do
need us, a loud call will carry to our camp, and we
can get here in three minutes coming by the lake-shore
path.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Then they sat about the fire, talking of many
things, until the blaze died down for lack of fuel.
And when Natalie would have replenished it, the
other girls voted against it.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Let’s go to bed,” proposed Alice. “Boys, we
don’t want to be inhospitable, but really you must
go. We are very tired.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Will you go for a trip on the lake to-morrow?”
asked Blake. “We have hired a little launch.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Will it run?” asked practical Marie.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Sometimes,” answered truthful Jack, and there
was another laugh.</p>

<p class='c009'>Good-nights were said, and soon, with the flaps
of their tent tightly drawn the girls prepared for
their first night in the woods. They had thoughtfully
filled a lantern that had been among their
camp-stuff, and its gleam through the white sides
of their tent could be seen amid the trees even as
far as the canvas shelter of the boys.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Last one under the covers put out the light,”
called Alice, as she made herself comfortable on
her cot.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Let’s burn it all night,” suggested Mabel.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I can’t sleep with a light,” declared Marie.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You are just like Cora Janet,” complained
Mabel, “she doesn’t like a light either.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Wouldn’t it be nice if Gertrude, Sadie, Margaret,
Edna and Cora were with us?” murmured
Alice.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Fine!” agreed Mabel. “But Cora never would
have a light.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Nor I,” said Marie.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’ll put something before it, so it won’t shine
in your eyes,” promised Mabel. “But really—the
first night you know—it’s so dark, and we don’t
know exactly where to find things——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What do you want to find things in your sleep
for?” demanded Natalie.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t know as I will, but if I do awaken I
like to see a light—especially in a strange place,”
replied Mabel.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Perhaps it will be a good plan to let it burn
low,” suggested Mrs. Bonnell, and they did.</p>

<p class='c009'>At first there was so much laughter and talk that
even sleepy Alice declared she felt wide awake.
They joked about every happening of the day, from
the young man who had tried to flirt with Natalie
on the boat, to the strange actions of Old Hanson.
Then the laughter became less frequent, and the
jokes seemed to lose their point.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Camp Fire Girls were asleep.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was Natalie who awakened. There seemed to
be some one scratching at the side of the tent near
the head of her cot. She sat up, not knowing, for
a moment or two, where she was. Then as she
saw the gleam of the white walls of their shelter
it came back to her. The others were calmly sleeping,
as their deep breathing indicated.</p>

<p class='c009'>The scratching was repeated. Then came an
unmistakable sneeze, and Natalie saw the wall of the
tent shake.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh!” she screamed. “Some one is trying to
get in! Oh, Alice—Mabel—Marie—Mrs. Bonnell!
Some one is trying to get in!”</p>

    <div>THE OLD MILL</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Cots creaked as four forms rose to sitting positions
on them. There were gasping intakes of
breath. Natalie, cowering amid the coverings
pointed with a shaking finger toward the tent wall
near her.</p>

<p class='c009'>“There—there!” she hoarsely whispered.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Boys! Boys!” screamed Marie. “Oh, Jack—Blake!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Where’s that am—am—ammonia gun?” demanded
Mabel, in shivering accents.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I—oh, where did I put it—under my pillow?
No, here it is,” and from an upturned box near her
cot—a box that served as bureau and chiffonier,
Mrs. Bonnell caught up her weapon.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Where is he?” she demanded of Natalie.</p>

<p class='c009'>“There—there—he was trying to crawl under
the tent! Oh, shoot!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Something spurted from the muzzle of the odd
little revolver, and a moment later there were other
kinds of screams.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, my eyes!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“My nose!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, what awful stuff!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“A-ker-choo” some one sneezed.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Will it explode from the flame of the lantern?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, Mrs. Bonnell! You aimed it right at me!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Did I, my dear? I guess my hand must have
shaken. Oh, but it is powerful; isn’t it?”</p>

<p class='c009'>And they all covered their streaming eyes from
the fumes of the ammonia, which, confined by the
closed tent, played havoc with them. Choking and
gasping Mrs. Bonnell jumped up to open one of the
tent flaps to let in air.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Did—did you hit—him?” gasped Mabel.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I—I didn’t see any one,” confessed the Guardian.
“Natalie did, though.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I—I didn’t really <i>see</i> him,” murmured breath-of-the-pine-tree.
“I—I heard him. Oh, please
some one hand me my cold cream. I can’t see—those
fumes from the ammonia are in my eyes.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Didn’t you see him?” demanded Marie, as she
tossed a tube of the cream over on Natalie’s cot.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No-o-o-o. There was a scratching sound, and I
woke up, and—and——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I shot!” declared Mrs. Bonnell.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You needn’t tell us that!” laughed Marie.
“We all know it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I couldn’t find the pistol at first,” went on the
Guardian, “for I had it in mind to put it under my
pillow, and then I was afraid it might leak, so I laid
it on my ‘bureau,’” and she smilingly indicated the
upturned soap box. “But I found it,” she went on.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m sure whoever it was won’t come back,”
spoke Alice. “Suppose we take a look.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Never!” cried Marie.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Hark! What’s that?” demanded Natalie, as
there sounded from without a trampling in the
bushes.</p>

<p class='c009'>“He’s coming back!” murmured Mabel. “Shoot
again, Mrs. Bonnell.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Cover your heads, girls!” advised Marie.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What’s the matter in there?” demanded a voice
they all recognized as Jack’s. “What has happened?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Shall we come in?” asked Blake.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don’t you dare!” cried Natalie. “Wait a
minute!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Taking warning the Camp Fire Girls draped
themselves more or less picturesquely in their robes.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Look around outside, and see if you can find
any one mortally wounded, Jack,” begged Marie of
her brother. “Then you may just peek in, and tell
us about it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>There was a flash of a lantern outside the tent,
and the voices of the three lads as they walked about
the shelter.</p>

<p class='c009'>“There he is!” Blake was heard to cry.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh—oh, is he—is he—dead?” faltered Mrs.
Bonnell.</p>

<p class='c009'>“He seems just to be having a fit,” answered Phil
with a chuckle.</p>

<p class='c009'>The girls heard a commotion amid the dead
leaves.</p>

<p class='c009'>“That ammonia was very strong,” murmured
Alice.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Behold your victim!” cried Jack, parting the
tent flaps, that had been allowed to fall back after
the fumes had been somewhat blown away. “Behold
your victim!” and by the tail, he held up to
view a small fox, the hapless animal appearing to
be in a sort of fit or stupor.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Take him away! Take him away!” screamed
Alice. “He’ll bite!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Not for some time,” replied Jack grimly. “You
did for him good and proper. Some of that liquid
ammonia must have gotten on him, Mrs. Bonnell.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh!” she exclaimed. “I didn’t mean to.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It will be a good lesson,” went on Phil, while
Jack tossed the fox into the bushes, the skin not
being in good condition, and also too small to use.
“He’ll be all right in a little while, and probably he
won’t come prowling about the tent after dark
again.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“There used to be lots of ’em, and—er—other
animals of the forest about our tent in other years,”
went on Phil, “until we found that leaving scraps
of food brought them. After that we buried all our
refuse and they didn’t come.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Girls, we’ll dig a deep hole the first thing in the
morning!” declared the Guardian.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We’ll do it for you,” offered Blake. “Can we
do anything more?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, thank you,” murmured Natalie. “It was
good of you to come.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why wouldn’t we; with all that yelling?” asked
Jack.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We thought the ghost of the old mill was carrying
you off,” explained Blake.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ugh! Don’t speak of it—we’ll never get another
wink of sleep,” declared Mabel.</p>

<p class='c009'>The boys departed, laughing and joking, and the
girls tried to compose themselves to slumber, but
it was not easy. However even a little rest in that
glorious balsam-laden air was enough, and they
awoke in the morning much refreshed.</p>

<p class='c009'>Water had been brought from the spring the
night before, and after simple toilets, simple perforce,
they arranged for breakfast. The boys had
brought them eggs from their supply, pending
arrangements the girls would make with a near-by
farmer, and with crisp bacon and coffee there was
a meal that even a jaded epicure might have partaken
of with delight.</p>

<p class='c009'>All about was a freshness; the trees with their
green leaves, the sparkling lake within a stone’s
throw of their dining canopy and the birds flitting
about overhead.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Glorious—glorious—most glorious!” murmured
Natalie. “I feel like writing a poem.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Compose it while you wash the dishes,” advised
Marie with a laugh.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, see the flowers, growing right back of our
tent!” exclaimed Mabel, as she arose from the table
to gather a clump of fern and some blue blossoms,
which she arranged in a cracked pitcher. “Isn’t
that artistic?” she demanded.</p>

<p class='c009'>“There’s condensed milk in that vase—pronounced
vaase,” murmured Alice with a chuckle,
and then a piece of bacon went down her “wrong
throat,” and Mabel declared that it served her right.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now to get our camp in order,” called Mrs.
Bonnell after the simple meal. “We must decide
who will be the hewers of wood and the drawers of
water,” she went on. “We will take turns in doing
the dishes, and cooking—in fact all the camp duties
ought to run in a sort of rotation, for the work
must be done.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Law of the Camp Fire number two,” murmured
Marie. “Give service.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Exactly,” laughed the Guardian.</p>

<p class='c009'>The girls had donned their comfortable bloomer
suits, for there was to be much activity.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then began a busy time, which was hardly ended
when from the path along the lake shore came a
hail:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Wo-he-lo ahoy!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s the boys!” exclaimed Mabel.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Dogwood camp!” answered Marie.</p>

<p class='c009'>“‘Come into my garden, Maude!’” invited
Blake.</p>

<p class='c009'>“He means come for a ride,” added Phil.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We’re too busy,” declared Mrs. Bonnell.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We’ll help you,” offered Jack. “Come! It’s
too fine a day to stay around camp. We’ll take you
to the haunted mill.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It doesn’t sound so scary in daylight,” spoke
Natalie, as the three lads came up the path from the
water.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Any more foxes?” asked Blake.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Thank goodness no.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Come on, boys. Wood and water; and help fill
the lanterns and oil stove!” suggested Jack. “Then
they’ll come with us,” and soon they had completed
the harder tasks of the camp. Then they helped
the girls arrange their cots and trunks differently so
as to give more room, put up some boxes to serve
as cupboards and storage places, and did other small
services that were much appreciated.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Will you trust yourselves in the launch?” asked
Jack, when they were ready to set out.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Will it blow up?” asked Marie.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, but it may stop in the middle of the lake.
But we can paddle back.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’ll go,” offered Natalie. “I want to see the
ancient mill and the hermit thereof.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Old Hanson may not be in,” suggested Phil.
“He’s always tramping off around the country.
But we can look over his shack.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Soon the merry party was in the launch, which,
though it was a bit wheezy, like some old man with
the asthma, still went along at good speed. They
talked, laughed and sang, and finally reached a
small dock, near which, according to the boys, was
located the old mill.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It used to grind the grist for the country round
about here,” explained Phil, as they took a woodland
path, so narrow that they had to walk Indian
file. “Then it was on a stream that used to run
into the lake. But the stream seems to have dried
up to a mere ditch, and the old mill is in ruins.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why didn’t I bring my camera!” exclaimed
Natalie. “I love to snap old ruins.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You’ll have plenty of chances,” said Blake.
“We’ll be here all summer, as we hope you will.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“We may, if the foxes leave us alone,” answered
Mrs. Bonnell. “Though I have plenty more of
ammonia.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Put some talcum powder in next time,” urged
Marie with a laugh.</p>

<p class='c009'>They tramped on for some little time longer,
gradually ascending from the level of the lake, until
they turned from a dense patch of woodland into a
little glade. Then the ruined mill confronted
them.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, isn’t it lovely!” exclaimed Marie.</p>

<p class='c009'>“A perfect dream,” declared Mabel.</p>

<p class='c009'>“So romantic,” was Natalie’s opinion. “Oh,
why did I leave my camera in the tent? I must
have a picture of that!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Truly it was a picturesque scene—a tumbled-down,
old mill, the ancient wheel mossy-green with
the growth of many years. The roof, in many
places, had fallen into decay, and the flapping shutters,
half-hanging on rusty hinges seemed like the
closing eyelids of a very old man. The doors
creaked dismally to and fro in the gentle wind, and
the crumbling steps which had been worn by many
tramping feet, were tumbling stone from stone.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And this is the haunted mill?” asked Natalie.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It is,” said Blake, simply. “A dark tragedy is
hidden behind its crumbling walls.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What is it?” asked Marie eagerly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It is a fearsome tale, gentle ladies, a tale for
the flickering camp fire rather than for the garish
light of day, but such as it is it shall e’en be told
unto you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Cut out the romantic slush, and give ’em the
facts,” broke in Jack. “It’s a mill that was built
somewhere around the Revolutionary time,” he went
on, “and the story goes that some women and children
who took refuge here during an Indian attack
were killed by the savages.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh!” murmured the girls.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Really, Jack?” asked his sister, who knew him
well.</p>

<p class='c009'>“That’s a fact,” declared Blake, “only he puts it
so crudely. He might add that on the anniversary
of the massacre the moans of the—er—of those who
were cut down in the flower of their youth—echo
through the old mill.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Stop it!” demanded Natalie. “Even in daylight
that’s bad enough. If you try to tell that after
dark we—we’ll——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Use the ammonia gun on him!” threatened Mrs.
Bonnell.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, I’m only telling you the story,” declared
Blake. “You don’t have to believe it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And does that old man who helped us live
here?” asked Alice.</p>

<p class='c009'>“In a little shack around in the back,” said Phil.
“Come on, we’ll look at it, and then we’ll go in the
mill.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And does he live in there?” came a chorus from
the girls, as they viewed the little shack which the
boys pointed out to them. It was a mere hut, consisting
of but a single room, into which they looked
through not too clean a window.</p>

<p class='c009'>“There is where he lives, moves and has his
being,” declaimed Blake. “I guess he isn’t in,” he
went on, as he rattled at the rickety door.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Blake!” remonstrated his sister. “He may
not like it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, we stand in good with Hanson,” declared
Jack. “We keep him in tobacco money.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Horrid!” murmured Natalie.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Let’s go in the mill,” suggested Jack. “There
is some curious old-fashioned machinery there that’s
worth seeing. This is an historical place.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I love old places,” murmured Natalie. “But,
oh! My camera!”</p>

<p class='c009'>A musty, old, and damp odor greeted them as
they crossed the rotting threshold of the ancient
mill.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mind the holes in the floor,” cautioned Jack.
“It’s no fun to step into one!”</p>

<p class='c009'>They advanced into the old structure and for a
moment stood in the middle of the sagging floor.
Overhead were cobwebbed beams and rafters, and
from somewhere below came the faint gurgle of the
former mill stream that had been wont, in years
past, to turn the big wheel.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It gives me the shivers!” confessed Mabel.
“Let’s go——”</p>

<p class='c009'>She did not finish the sentence. Through the
hollow stillness that seemed to weigh down her
words sounded a mournful groan.</p>

    <div>AN EXCITED CONSTABLE</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>“What was that?” whispered Marie.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Some one is hurt!” murmured Natalie.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mrs. Bonnell began a search for her useful little
ammonia gun, but found she had left it in camp.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Where was that noise, fellows?” demanded
practical Jack. Before any of them could answer
him the groan sounded again, louder than before.
With a bound Marie was out of the door narrowly
missing a fall on the rickety steps. Mabel followed,
but Natalie and Alice stood their ground, perhaps
because Mrs. Bonnell had grasped each of them by
an arm.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don’t be silly,” exclaimed Phil. “Probably it’s
only a tramp who’s talking in his sleep.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“A tramp!” gasped Natalie.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Come out of here!” demanded Alice, getting,
ready for a retreat.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It was upstairs,” said Blake, indicating a flight
of rotting steps. “Some one is up there.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Again the groan sounded, and there was no mistaking
it. It did come from above their heads.
Then a voice called:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Is any one there? Help me! I’ve had a fall!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s old man Hanson!” exclaimed Jack. “He’s
up there. Come on, boys!”</p>

<p class='c009'>He sprang forward. Blake called after him:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Be careful of those stairs. They look as if
they’d come down if you blew on ’em.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“If they held him to go up, they’ll stand for me,”
declared Jack. “Come on!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Let’s go outside,” suggested Mrs. Bonnell. “If
you need us, boys, you can call us,” she added. “If
he is hurt, I know something about first-aid work.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“We’ll call you if we need you,” replied Blake.
“Now let’s have a look.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Cautiously they went up the shaky stairs, one at
a time so as not to put too much of a strain on them.
At first it was so dark in the second story that they
could see nothing. Then Jack called:</p>

<p class='c009'>“What’s the matter? Who is it? Are you
hurt?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s me—Hanson Rossmore,” was the halting
answer. “I tripped in a hole and sprained my ankle
I guess. Can you help me down?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I guess so,” answered Jack. “Let’s get a little
light on the subject though,” and he opened one of
the old solid-wood shutters, that covered the glassless
window.</p>

<p class='c009'>They saw the old hermit, for such he was, lying
in the corner of what had evidently been a storeroom
of the old mill. He seemed in pain, and one leg was
doubled under him.</p>

<p class='c009'>“How did it happen?” asked Jack, as the boys
raised him up.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ouch! Oh, my!” he cried, as the weight came
on the injured foot. “I can’t step on it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Wait, I’ll get you a stick,” volunteered Blake,
hurrying outside.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Is he—is he dead?” asked Mabel.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Dead! And him groaning the way he did?
Not much!” cried the lad. “It’s only a sprained
ankle or something like that. We’ll get him to his
shack and he’ll be all right.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Poor old man,” murmured Natalie.</p>

<p class='c009'>With the help of the improvised cane, and with
a lad on either side of him, they managed to get Old
Hanson down the stairs, though they were in fear
lest every step would bring the whole flight down
about them, so rickety was it.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What were you doing up there?” asked Blake,
as they led him out of the door, and toward his own
little shack.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, just looking around—looking around,” he
murmured. “I used to work in this mill when I was
a boy, and it has memories for me—memories—yes
memories. Some happy and some sad. I’m an old
man!”</p>

<p class='c009'>They got him to his hut, and then took off his
shoe. His left ankle was much swollen, though it
appeared to be more of a cut than a sprain that had
caused the injury. Under the direction of Mrs.
Bonnell they bandaged it with rags they found,
wringing them out of hot water, for Blake made a
fire in the old stove.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s kind of you—right kind—to bother with an
old hulk like me,” went on Old Hanson. “That
feels a lot better. I had a daughter once,” he said,
looking fixedly at Natalie. “She was like you, in
a way. That’s why I was so startled by your face
the first time I saw you. But she’s gone—gone.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Where?” asked Jack.</p>

<p class='c009'>“How should I know?” came the rather angry
retort. “I don’t know. I only go up in the old mill
when I want to think about her. I was there to-day.
I stepped in a hole—the old mill is falling apart, just
as I am—it’s getting old like me, only I’ll never be
as old as that.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s older than the Indians. The Indians were
here once. They killed some settlers in the mill.
Sometimes in the night I hear cries—cries of——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That’ll do!” interrupted Blake a bit sternly,
seeing that the old chap was getting on the nerves
of the girls who stood outside the shack. “You’ll
work into a fever if you’re not careful. Never
mind about the past.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s all I live in,” said the hermit simply. “But
I won’t say anything more. I wonder how I’m to
get about?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It will be all right in a day or so,” said Mrs.
Bonnell who had looked at it. “It isn’t a bad cut.
Just keep your weight off it. We’ll bring you some
food so you won’t have to go out.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Thanks,” he murmured, as he lay back in an
old chair.</p>

<p class='c009'>The boys did what they could for him, and then
left with the girls in the launch, promising to come
back later with food enough to last for several days.</p>

<p class='c009'>This they did, the Camp Fire Girls insisting on
providing their share, for they felt kindly toward
the old man, and, as Mabel said, they were pledged
to give service, and here was a chance to do it.</p>

<p class='c009'>With the boys, they also paid him another visit,
finding him much improved. He could hobble
about, and inside of a week he was able to resume
his odd tasks about the lake, for he was hired by a
number of the cottagers and campers to look after
their places.</p>

<p class='c009'>Green Lake was beginning to assume life. Many
new camps were opened, as well as a number of
summer residences. The Camp Fire Girls were delighted
with their new life. They got into the swing
of living in the open, sleeping in a tent, and dining
as they pleased.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s the ideal of the simple life,” declared Marie.
“I wonder we never thought of it before.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And we all feel so much better,” added
Mabel.</p>

<p class='c009'>They had established a sort of routine, for Mrs.
Bonnell realized the necessity of this, and the work,
well divided, was not a task at all. Breakfast over
they made the camp “slick,” as the boys expressed
it, though the lads did not always follow that
injunction themselves. Then came a row or a paddle
on the lake, for they had hired a canoe, and a row
boat. Or perhaps they went out with the boys.</p>

<p class='c009'>There was the trip to the nearest post-office for
mail, or to drop letters home and to friends. Then
there was the buying of supplies, though the butcher
and grocer, now that the lake shores were better
populated, came every day.</p>

<p class='c009'>Followed next the mid-day meal. Then more
pleasures of the woods or water, receiving visitors,
or making calls on new acquaintances.</p>

<p class='c009'>They did not lack for enjoyment in the evenings.
Either they went to their brothers’ camp, or the
boys, their forces augmented by such of their friends
as they condescended to ask, called. Then there
were dances over to the “Point”, the place where
a cluster of stores were located. Then to bed, with
the assurance of a sound sleep in that healthful air.
It was an ideal sort of existence.</p>

<p class='c009'>On occasions they held the regular Council
Camp Fires, with all the prescribed ceremonies.
There was the lighting of the fire, the singing of
the songs and the Indian music;—the song of the
“Sky-blue Water.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Sometimes it rained, and they could only sit in
the tent, though when it did not pour too hard they
put on their bathing costumes, and went out in the
canoe.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Who’s turn to get dinner to-day?” asked Marie
one morning, as they came back from a launch ride,
bringing some dainties to supplement the regular
camp-fare.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mine, I think,” spoke Natalie. “What would
you like?”</p>

<p class='c009'>There were four different kinds of meals ordered,
and each one insisted on something different until
breath-of-the-pine-tree exclaimed:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now I shall have to make up my own bill of
fare. All of you go off in the woods, and when it’s
ready I’ll give our call.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“All right, Natalie,” they assented and off they
trooped.</p>

<p class='c009'>Natalie, in her Camp Fire suit, which wonderfully
became her, with her dark braids down her back,
and with a golden bandeau confining the locks over
her broad forehead set about her task.</p>

<p class='c009'>She was setting the table, giving attention the
while to the oil stove, which evinced a propensity to
smoke, when she heard the crunch of gravel at the
lake shore.</p>

<p class='c009'>Looking up, expecting to see one of the boys, she
beheld a grizzled, stoop-shouldered little man approaching.
On the breast of his coat was a shiny
nickel star, and as he saw Natalie, looking more
than ever like an Indian maid with her coat of tan,
he exclaimed:</p>

<p class='c009'>“I want you!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Wh—what?” she gasped, looking about in dismay
for a sight of her friends.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I want you. No foolin’ now. I know you!
You’re dressed jest as they said you was. Now you
come along with me or it’ll be th’ wuss fer ye! I’m
Constable Jackson, I be, an’ I know my duty. I’ve
got th’ law with me!” he added, excitedly tapping
the star on his coat. “This is th’ law, an’ I want
you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Natalie shrank back frightened as the man advanced.
She thought she had to do with some over-bold
tramp, and was about to call for help. Before
she could flee, the man sprang to her side. He was
about to grasp her by the arm, when he was suddenly
whirled to one side, and the welcome voice of
Blake Lathrop exclaimed:</p>

<p class='c009'>“That’ll do you! What do you want, anyhow?”
and he stepped in front of Natalie.</p>

    <div>OVERBOARD</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>For a moment Constable Jackson, as he had called
himself, staggered to retain his footing, for Blake
had used no gentleness in thrusting him to one side.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ah—ha!” the man finally managed to gasp, as
he steadied himself by seizing a slender sapling.
“What do you mean, young man? How dare you
lay hands on me? I represent the law, I do!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then I’m sorry for the law,” was Blake’s cool
response. “What are you doing here, anyhow?
Don’t you know that this is private property?
These young ladies rent this camping-ground, and
you’re as much a trespasser as if they owned it.
What are you doing here, anyhow?” and Blake’s
voice was stern.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m not going to answer your questions, young
man, unless I want to,” the constable fired back.
“And you’re doing a mighty risky thing in interfering
with the majesty of the law. I am it!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Glad you told me,” murmured the lad, “otherwise
I might not have known it,” and he laughed.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Be careful!” warned the constable. “I can
arrest you too, if I like!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Arrest!” gasped Natalie, who had somewhat
recovered her composure at the advent of Blake.
The other boys and girls were not in sight.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, arrest! I thought I’d make you take back-water.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m not taking back-water, as you call it, at all,”
said Blake sharply, “I am merely curious. What
do you mean? Once more I ask why you are here?
And if you don’t give an account of yourself, I’ll
run you off the place,” and Blake looked very much
able to do it, a fact, which even gentle Natalie was
gladly aware of at that moment.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Be careful,” needlessly warned Constable Jackson.
“I’m here on account of this—it’s my
authority,” and again he tapped the nickel star on
his coat.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Authority for what?” snapped Blake.</p>

<p class='c009'>“For taking her. I’ve got a warrant!” and he
pointed a stubby finger at Natalie. “It calls for the
arrest of one Hadee, a Gypsy girl for the ‘feloniously
taking, carrying away and converting the
same to her own use of one pocket-book, said to contain
the sum of fourteen dollars and thirteen cents,
the property of Mrs. Josiah Applebaum, with force
and arms, contrary to the statutes in such cases
made and provided,’” and he drew from his pocket a
paper, from which he appeared to have quoted the
last few words with great satisfaction. “That’s
why I’m here,” the constable went on, “and when
I go away I’m going to take her with me!” and he
took a step toward Natalie.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No! No!” she gasped. “There’s some mistake.
Oh, Blake!” and she stepped toward the
youth.</p>

<p class='c009'>“There now,” he soothed her. “Don’t you be a
bit alarmed. Of course there’s a mistake. You
sha’n’t stir a step!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, she won’t; eh?” jeered the representative
of the law.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No!” declared Blake. “As she says there has
been a mistake, and it’s you who are making it.
So you take her for some Gypsy girl; eh?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I sure do. The description fits perfect. Dressed
like some Indian girl—hair down her back, ribbon
around it and all. Of course she’s the one I want!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And you say she is Hadee?” asked Blake
curiously, making a sign to Natalie not to show that
she recognized the name.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes; but that don’t matter. Names is easy
made up. Now will you come along peaceable, or
not?” and he glared at Natalie.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I—I—” she began.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Wait,” spoke Blake, “I’ll answer him. In the
first place,” he went on, “this is Miss Natalie Fuller,
a friend of mine. With two boy friends, I am
camping over at Stony Point. Miss Fuller and four
chums are camping here. I can give you their
names. I can also refer you to Mr. Henderson, the
storekeeper, who knows us all. We might know
this Gypsy Hadee you speak of, for some of the girls
have had their fortunes told, but I’m positive Miss
Fuller has taken no pocket-book. Her costume is
that of the Camp Fire Girls’ Association, as we can
show you in the official book. Now what do you
say?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, all I’ve got to say that I’ve got a warrant
for Hadee,” declared the constable sullenly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“But not for Miss Fuller,” insisted Blake. “If
you’ll use your eyes you’ll see that she isn’t at all
like a Gypsy girl, though she does wear her hair
that way,” and at this Natalie smiled a little.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, maybe they did make a mistake,” admitted
Constable Jackson. Evidently the array of
facts that Blake shot at him rather staggered the
representative of the law.</p>

<p class='c009'>“They!” exclaimed Blake. “I think <i>you</i> did.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I didn’t mean to,” the man went on. “After I
got the warrant I made some inquiries. Some one
told me there was Gypsy girls camping over here,
and I come.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“So they take us for Gypsies!” exclaimed Natalie.
“Oh, what will the Camp Fire Girls say to
this?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What about this pocket-book?” asked Blake.
“Did a Gypsy really take it?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Here’s all I know,” said the constable. “Josiah
Applebaum, he lives over on the Woodport
road, come to town yist’day and complained to
Squire Grover that a Gypsy had visited his wife,
told her fortune, and, when she left, the pocket-book
that was on the table went too!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh!” exclaimed Natalie.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What’d you say?” demanded the constable.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Nothing,” answered Blake for her, giving his
friend a warning look. “Go on.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That’s all there is to it. The squire made out
the warrant for the girl, who give the name Hadee,
though whether it’s her right one or not I don’t
know—it’s a heathen name, anyhow.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And you came here after her?” questioned
Blake.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, havin’ heard there was Gypsies here.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And now you see you’re wrong?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, you say so. And it don’t exactly look
like a Gypsy camp, either,” Mr. Jackson admitted.
“Do you know where I can find ’em?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Not in the least,” Blake replied. “You’ll have
to use your detective abilities. But I advise you to
be a little more sure next time, before you make accusations.
If I had not come along you might have
frightened Miss Fuller.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I didn’t mean to,” murmured the man. “Well,
I’ll go looking for this Hadee, though I don’t believe
there’ll be much money left in th’ pocket-book
when I git it,” and he started off, looking rather
suspiciously at Natalie.</p>

<p class='c009'>The voices of the other girls, and Mrs. Bonnell
approaching through the woods, were heard now,
and as they saw Natalie and Blake and the retreating
constable Marie cried:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, what has happened? Is anything wrong?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“This man is the only one in wrong,” said Blake
grimly. “He came to arrest Natalie as a Gypsy
pocket-book embezzler.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, Natalie!” came in a chorus.</p>

<p class='c009'>If there had been any doubt in the mind of the
constable, it vanished at the sight of the others.
Putting his warrant back in his pocket, and murmuring
some indistinguishable words he slowly
rowed away in his boat, as Jack and Phil came
along the lake-shore path to the girls’ camp.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What’s the row?” demanded Jack. “What
did old Jackson want? Has some one been cutting
down trees again?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Blake explained, and his two chums were waxing
very indignant until Natalie informed them
that, after all it was a very natural mistake, and
that no harm had been done.</p>

<p class='c009'>“If you will look so much like a charming Indian
maid, I suppose you must put up with the consequences,
breath-of-the-pine-tree,” said Mabel. “It
is the penalty of—well, notoriety.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, your fame must have spread,” remarked
Alice.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, I wish some bread was spread,” declared
Marie. “I’m as hungry as—well, as the hungriest
animal in the woods. Is dinner ready, Nat?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I was getting it when I came near going to
prison,” laughed Natalie. “If you’ll all help it
will soon be on the table.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“We’ll help!” exclaimed Jack eagerly. “We
haven’t anything much in the grub line at our camp.
Ask us, won’t you?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Shall we, girls?” inquired Mabel.</p>

<p class='c009'>“In view of Blake’s rescue, I think we might,”
suggested Mrs. Bonnell, and soon a merry little
party was gathered under the dining canvas.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And, Oh, girls!” cried Natalie. “Do you
know what I was thinking of when that constable
was telling why he thought he wanted me?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Probably wondering how you’d like to live on
bread and water,” suggested Alice. “I believe
that is what prisoners receive.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Nothing of the sort!” exclaimed Natalie.
“But when he told how this Hadee—which may
be Gypsy for Hattie—when he said how she told
the farmer’s wife fortune, and then left with the
pocket-book, I was thinking of Mabel’s mother’s
ring. That girl gave the same name, you know.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That’s so!” exclaimed Mabel. “The two
cases are just alike. This Hadee may be a professional
larcerner, to speak in polite language.
Oh, boys! Can’t you locate her camp, and make
her give back mother’s ring?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I never thought of that,” spoke Blake. “There
may be something in it. Fellows, shall we have a
try?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Where is the camp?” asked Jack.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t know, but if Jackson can get on the
trail, I should think we could,” went on Natalie’s
champion. “Let’s think about it, anyhow.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And if you boys don’t find it, maybe we can,”
put in Alice.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You girls! You’d never dare go off in the
woods alone, looking for a Gypsy camp; you’d get
lost!” declared Phil.</p>

<p class='c009'>“That shows how little he knows about the
Camp Fire Girls!” exclaimed Marie. “Know then,
rash youth, that we are instructed in the following
of trails—Gypsy as well as Indian—that we know
how to ‘blaze’ our way as well as do your boy
scouts, and that, while we may not be adepts, still
we can read some signs of woodlore. Can’t we,
girls?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“We can!” came in a chorus.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I know that moss grows on the South—no, the
East side of a tree!” said Alice. “At least I think
it does. And the East star——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“North star—moss on the North side, too!”
broke in Mabel. “How forgetful you are, Alice.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I know I am. Anyhow, do you think we could
find this Gypsy camp?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“We’ll find it for you,” promised Jack. “What
do you say to a trip on the water this afternoon?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“In the launch?” asked Mrs. Bonnell.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Unfortunately the launch is out of commission,”
explained Blake. “Jack was trying to fix
the carburettor and he got it out of adjustment.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I did not. It was broke before I touched it!”
declared Jack indignantly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Anyhow the boat’s gasolene circulation seems
to be wrong,” went on Blake. “It runs backwards
like a crab, instead of forward. So I guess we
shall have to take to the oars. We have sent for a
boat-doctor.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’d like to row,” ventured Natalie.</p>

<p class='c009'>“My canoe holds two very nicely,” put in Blake,
quickly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And it’s as wabbley as a fellow just learning to
skate,” declared Jack. “Come with me, Nat, in
my good old tub.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“After the gallant manner in which I saved her
from the clutches of the law? I guess not,” exclaimed
Blake. “You’ll come canoeing, won’t you,
Natalie?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I think so—for a little while,” she promised.</p>

<p class='c009'>The others paired off somehow, and soon a little
flotilla of boats was slowly moving along the shady
side of the lake. The occupants talked of many
things, chiefly of the visit of the constable.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Where do you suppose the Gypsy camp could
be?” asked Mabel, calling to Blake, near whose
canoe she and Jack were, in a rowboat.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It might be almost anywhere,” he answered.
“We’ll see Jackson to-morrow, and ask if he has
learned anything.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Do you think this Hadee could possibly be the
same one?” went on the girl whose mother’s ring
had been taken.</p>

<p class='c009'>“From—er—from the method of operation I
should think it very likely,” said Blake. “Look
out!” he called suddenly to Phil who was rowing
with Marie. “Pull over!”</p>

<p class='c009'>But he was too late. Phil’s boat struck the frail
canoe, tilted it sharply, and the next moment Blake
and Natalie were in the waters of the lake.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Overboard!” yelled Jack. “Steady! We’ll
get you!”</p>

<p class='c009'>The other girls screamed, until a stern command
from Mrs. Bonnell quieted them. Jack and Phil,
keeping their wits about them rowed toward the
overturned canoe. An instant later Blake came up,
gasping. With a shake of his head he cleared his
eyes of water, and then looked around for Natalie.
She had sunk out of sight.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c007'>
    <div>OFF TO THE GYPSY CAMP</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>“Let—let me get her!” gasped Blake, as he
whirled about in the water, seeking the tell-tale train
of bubbles that might indicate the presence of the
girl.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No!” cried Jack. “You get in the boat.
Your wet clothes are too heavy. I’ll dive for her.
I saw where she went down!”</p>

<p class='c009'>There was wisdom in this, as Blake well knew,
and, though he would have dared anything to make
the rescue, he realized that Jack’s plan was best.
The latter had already thrown off his coat, and
kicked loose his rubber-soled low shoes. Clad in a
pair of light-weight trousers, and a sleeveless shirt,
he poised for a moment on the bow of the boat,
and then dived.</p>

<p class='c009'>He cut the water cleanly, and Blake, swimming
to Phil’s boat, managed to get in over the stem, Phil
with an agonized look on his face holding it steady.
Mrs. Bonnell, who with Mabel and Alice was in
Jack’s boat, looked to see the result of his dive.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It wasn’t your fault, Phil,” said the Guardian
gently. “It wasn’t a very hard bump. The canoe
is a very tippy one.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That’s right!” gasped Blake.</p>

<p class='c009'>It seemed an age ere Jack came shooting up out
of the water. With a shake of his head he cleared
his eyes and mouth, and cried:</p>

<p class='c009'>“I saw her—on the—bottom!” he gasped.
“But—she was too far over. I’ll dive again. I
can get her—stay here!” he called to Phil, and
Blake, who seemed about to leap overboard.</p>

<p class='c009'>Filling his lungs with air, Jack again dived. They
could watch him by the commotion in the water, and
when he presently appeared, bearing the unconscious
form of Natalie to the surface, Phil gave a
spasmodic yell, the others joining in.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Get her into your boat, Phil—it’s larger,” commanded
Mrs. Bonnell. “Then row to shore as
fast as you can. We’ll have to practice first aid
work, just as we did in class, girls,” she added, for
the Camp Fire rules called for a girl knowing how
to resuscitate an apparently drowned person.</p>

<p class='c009'>It did not take long to get Natalie into the boat,
and then with feverishly rapid strokes Phil rowed
to shore, the others following.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Make a little pillow of your coats, boys,” commanded
Mrs. Bonnell. “We’ll place that under her,
as she lies face down. That will help to drain the
water out of her lungs.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The inert form of Natalie was rolled over, until
some water did come from her lips. Then, directing
the efforts of Jack and Phil, Mrs. Bonnell had
them raise the girl’s arms above her head, while
she pressed on the diaphragm to facilitate the getting
of air into the lungs.</p>

<p class='c009'>Natalie had only been a short time in the water,
and, as it developed later, her head had struck on
the gunwale of the canoe, rendering her unconscious,
so that she had swallowed only a little water.
The blow, in a measure, was lucky for her, since it
made her rescue easier. She had not struggled in
Jack’s grip.</p>

<p class='c009'>“There!” exclaimed Mrs. Bonnell, as a tremor
of the white eyelids, and a gentle sigh, told that
consciousness was returning. “She’s coming to!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ah!” breathed Phil in relief. He had been
under a great strain.</p>

<p class='c009'>Natalie opened her eyes.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What happened? Did I— Oh, I remember,”
she gasped. “I fell out of the boat. How silly!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Not at all!” exclaimed Marie. “How do you
feel?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Rather—rather weak,” was the answer.</p>

<p class='c009'>“She ought to have a warm drink,” exclaimed
Mabel. “Oh, if we could only make a fire, and heat
some coffee!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“We can make a fire,” said Phil, “but the coffee
is out of the question. We’d better get back to
camp. It was all my fault. I should have looked
where I rowed.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, I got in the way,” declared Blake. “I
should have told Nat to sit down on the bottom of
the canoe, instead of on the seat, but she wanted
to improve her paddle stroke.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Natalie shivered as she sat up. A little color was
beginning to show in her cheeks.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I have it!” cried Jack. “We’re not far from
the old mill. I’ll run over there, and get Old Hanson
to make some coffee!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’ll go!” volunteered Phil, anxious to be of
service.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, let me,” insisted Jack. “I want to get
dry and the run will do the trick,” and he was
off on a path that led to the mysterious mill.</p>

<p class='c009'>He was lucky in finding Old Hanson in his
shack. The solitary man was just starting a fire
for supper. The kettle was boiling and, quickly explaining
the need, Jack helped make coffee. Then,
with a pailful of the steaming beverage, while Hanson
came after him with a blanket, the lad hurried
back to where the others were.</p>

<p class='c009'>The coffee was just what Natalie needed and it
sent the warm blood into her now rather more pale
than olive cheeks. She insisted on Jack and Blake
taking some of the beverage, which they consented
to do. For, though, the day was warm, their damp,
clinging clothes were none too comfortable.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Here, wrap her in this blanket,” urged Old
Hanson as he came up. “It’s clean,” he added
quickly, “I only use it as a spread for the couch.
It will keep her from getting a cold.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Natalie gladly wound it about her, and then,
looking more than ever like an Indian maiden she
was helped down to the smaller boat. Jack offered
to row her to camp, and no one disputed him the
honor. Mrs. Bonnell went with them to assist
Natalie on reaching the tent. The others came on
more leisurely, the overturned canoe having been
righted.</p>

<p class='c009'>Jack never rowed so fast in his life and he was
in a warm, rosy glow when Crystal Springs was
reached. Natalie, too, was much improved, and
soon, clad in warm, dry garments she was herself
again. The others came on, and then the whole
affair was gone over in detail, each one telling his
or her feelings during the crucial moments.</p>

<p class='c009'>Phil was contrition itself, but no one blamed him,
though they all agreed that they must all use more
care in the future. The next day saw no ill effects
of the accident, though Natalie remained rather
quietly about camp, stretched in a barrel stave hammock
the boys had made in honor of her “convalescence,”
as they called it.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Where are you boys going?” asked Marie, a
few days later, as the three chums stopped in their
repaired motor craft at the small dock of Dogwood
Camp.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We’re going to see if we can find that Gypsy
outfit,” explained Jack. “We’re going to ask Old
Hanson if he knows anything about it, and, incidentally,
we’ll take him back his blanket. He may
need it. Want to come, girls?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I think not,” said Mrs. Bonnell for them. “We
have some work to do about camp, and, really, if
you do locate those Gypsies I think you boys had
better deal with them.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“We’ll deal all right!” exclaimed Phil grimly.
“Maybe we had better size up their place, though,
before we take the girls over. Come on, fellows,”
and after a brief stay at the camp of their friends
they went across the lake in the motor boat, which
seemed to be running well.</p>

<p class='c009'>There were many little details to be looked after
about the tents, and, as the Camp Fire Girls were
working for their “degrees,” as they called them,
they divided up the tasks.</p>

<p class='c009'>“For we will want to become Fire Makers, after
our probation as Wood Gatherers is up,” said
Natalie. “Some of you can qualify under some of
the rules about knowing what to do when a person
is nearly drowned,” she added, looking fondly at
her friends. “Though I can’t understand what
happened to me. I know how to swim.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It was that blow on the head,” declared the
Guardian, “And yet maybe it was a good thing for
you, for with your water-soaked clothing you might
have tried to swim and have failed. I shall take
into consideration what you girls did in the emergency,
though,” she went on, “and it will count
when you come up for the next step in the Camp
Fire ritual. But you must not forget the twenty
elective honors.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You can choose from health, home, nature,
camp or hand craft, business or patriotism,” she
went on. “I suggest camp-craft nature-lore or
hand-craft while you are here in the woods. You
will have time enough for the others when we go
back to Middleford.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, I don’t ever want to go back—not in such
lovely weather as this,” exclaimed Alice. “It is perfect
here.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And so restful,” added Mabel, who was darning
some stockings, with a green apple to bring the
holes up into rounded relief.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I know what I’m going to do!” exclaimed
Natalie, as she went in the main tent, to come out
presently with a big apron over her brown suit.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Wash the dishes?” asked Mabel, for they had
only eaten a light lunch that day, and the utensils
had been left until after the night meal.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, I’m going to see if that red clay can be
modeled into anything like a vase,” said Natalie, for
near the drinking spring they had found a bed of
sticky clay a day or so before, and Natalie had
brought a sample to camp. Soon she was busily engaged
in mixing it with water, and then the others
watched her curiously as she moulded it into a
rudely-formed but not inartistic vase of the Navajo
style.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Fine!” cried Mrs. Bonnell, when it was finished.
“Now if you can bake it in the fire, you’ll
have something really pretty.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m going to try,” said Natalie. “But I think
I’ll make a pit first, build a fire in that, and then,
when the embers are hot, I’ll cover the vase with
them. It will have to dry a bit in the sun first, anyhow,”
and she set her creation down in a warm spot
while she looked for something with which to dig
the fire hole.</p>

<p class='c009'>“There was a shovel around somewhere,” suggested
Mabel. “I saw Marie have it last.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I used it to dig some ferns with,” the latter admitted,
“but I put it back under the tent platform.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It isn’t there,” said Natalie, after a search.
“But I can use the hatchet,” and with that she began
to dig. When she had her pit-fire made, however,
she found that her vase was still to soft to
bake, so she decided to let it stand until the next
day.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Let’s all make something,” suggested Marie,
and soon the four were well daubed with the red
clay, that lent itself so readily to moulding.</p>

<p class='c009'>The boys came back just before supper, tired
and hungry and they quickly accepted an invitation
of the Camp Fire Girls to take “pot-luck” with
them.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Did you find the Gypsy camp?” asked Mabel
eagerly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Not a trace of it,” replied Blake. “Old Hanson
thought he knew where it was, but we tramped
miles and miles, and never saw the smoke of their
fires.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“We’ll ask that constable the first time we see
him,” added Jack. “He’ll probably know.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“If he doesn’t we’ll find it ourselves,” declared
Alice. “I’m not afraid—if we all go together—I
mean we girls!” she quickly added.</p>

<p class='c009'>The doings of the day were talked over, and
plans made for both parties to go next day to the
nearest store for some needed camp supplies. Then
followed a delightful hour around the fire for which
the faithful Wood Gatherers had provided plenty
of fuel. There was the singing of some simple
choruses, which they all knew, or in lieu, hummed.
Stories were told and then came the farewells.</p>

<p class='c009'>In the middle of the night Mrs. Bonnell was
awakened by a queer, thumping sound that seemed
to come from the space between the cooking and
sleeping tents—where a canvas shaded a wooden
platform, on which the table was placed.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I wonder if that can be my ammonia-fox?” she
murmured as she reached for her trusty little
weapon.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I think I’ll take a look before I fire,” she
thought. None of the girls was awakened.</p>

<p class='c009'>Cautiously peering out through the tent flaps,
the Guardian saw a curious sight. She could not
restrain a laugh, at the sound of which Natalie suddenly
sat up on her cot.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What is it?” she demanded in a whisper.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Come and see!” answered Mrs. Bonnell. “It’s
too odd—the poor creature!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Natalie glided to her side, while the queer thumping
sound continued.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>“My vase!” gasped Natalie. “He’ll break it!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I guess that’s the only way to get it off his
head,” answered Mrs. Bonnell, still laughing.
“Poor little fellow! He must have thought it contained
something good to eat.”</p>

<p class='c009'>This is what the two saw.</p>

<p class='c009'>A little raccoon was backing about the platform
under the eating table, his head thrust into the now
dried neck of the clay vase which Natalie had
moulded. She had brought it up on the boards,
under the canvas, to keep the dew from moistening
it.</p>

<p class='c009'>The raccoon, either through curiosity or hunger,
had thrust his slender snout into the opening, and
now could not withdraw it. It went just far enough
over his eyes so that he could not see, and the creature
was rushing aimlessly about, doubtless wondering
what queer trap he had blundered into. The
banging of the clay vase against the legs of the
sawhorses which held the table boards, and the
thumping on the wooden floor had aroused the
sleepers.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m going to get my vase!” exclaimed Natalie
determinedly as she thrust her feet into a pair of
bathing shoes and glided from the tent.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Come back!” cried Mrs. Bonnell! “He’ll bite
you!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“He can’t,” answered Natalie coolly. “His
mouth is inside the vase.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then’ll he scratch you!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t believe so. He’s too busy trying to paw
that vase off. Anyhow I’ll grab him by the tail and
pull. It won’t hurt him, and I don’t want my vase
smashed, after all my work.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What’s the matter?” gasped Mabel, now
awake.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Is—is it the Gypsies?” demanded Marie.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Where’s your ammonia gun?” cried Alice.
“Shoot!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Hush! Or you’ll have the boys over here!”
exclaimed Mrs. Bonnell. “It’s nothing but a raccoon
who stuck his head into Natalie’s vase. She’s
gone to free it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>As she spoke the thumping noise outside increased.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh!” cried Mabel.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Quiet!” urged the Guardian.</p>

<p class='c009'>“There, there!” Natalie’s voice could be heard
to murmur soothingly. “I won’t hurt you. Wait
a minute now, and I’ll have it off you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“She talks as if it were a pussy cat,” whispered
Alice.</p>

<p class='c009'>There was a little squeal, a sort of grunt and
then a hurried scurrying of feet over the boards.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I fixed him!” exclaimed Natalie in triumph,
as she came into the tent carrying her vase.</p>

<p class='c009'>“However did you dare to it?” demanded Alice.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why, the raccoon couldn’t see me, so I just
grabbed him by the tail in one hand, and took the
vase in the other. Then I—well, I just pulled them
apart.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, dear!” laughed Marie. “Oh, dear! Oh,
dear!” and she fell back on her cot in a paroxysm
of laughter. “Oh, dear, girls! Hold me, some
one!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What’s the matter now?” demanded Mabel.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, I just thought of the funniest thing!” and
Marie redoubled her mirth.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Be quiet!” commanded Mrs. Bonnell, and then
she joined in the gale of laughter that now swept
through the tent. “What is it, anyhow? Tell us
and we’ll laugh with you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, dear!” sighed Marie, as the first spasm
passed. “I just happened to think how dreadful
it would be, if, when Nat was pulling on the raccoon’s
tail, it had come loose instead of his head
coming out of the vase. Oh, dear!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Silly!” exclaimed Natalie. “It couldn’t happen.
Anyhow if it had the tail would have made
a lovely dusting brush!”</p>

<p class='c009'>And then there was more laughter.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We’d better bring in all the clay vases,” suggested
Natalie, when quiet had been somewhat restored.
“Some other night prowler may come
along and get caught in the same way.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t believe that raccoon will,” was Marie’s
opinion as she went off in another fit of laughter.
“The idea of pulling him out by the tail!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s the only way I could grab him,” explained
Natalie. “I didn’t want to get scratched.
Bur-r-r-r! It’s chilly!” and she crept back into bed,
while the other girls made hurried trips out to bring
in their handiwork.</p>

<p class='c009'>There were no more disturbances that night,
though Marie kept them all awake for some time,
with her fits of laughter and her murmurings of:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Suppose his tail had come off!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Suppose you go to sleep,” directed Mrs. Bonnell,
trying not to laugh.</p>

<p class='c009'>The clay ornaments were found hard enough by
morning to harden in the fire, and while the girls
were making a larger pit than the one Natalie had
originally dug, the boys strolled over.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Going to have a feast?” asked Blake.</p>

<p class='c009'>“A feast? no,” replied Alice, who was scooping
out the dirt. “Why do you ask?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Because you’re digging a hole, and you have a
lot of clay around. I thought maybe you were going
to clay a chicken.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Clay a chicken?” repeated Mrs. Bonnell. “Is
that a new way of serving it?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s the camp version of a casserole,” explained
Jack. “You take a chicken, wrap a cloth around it,
and then plaster it all over with clay. Then you
make a fire in a hole, put the clayed chicken in, cover
it with embers, and go fishing.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What has fishing got to do with it?” asked
Mabel.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You don’t have to think any more about your
dinner,” said Jack. “It’s like a fireless cooker, with
the fire still in it. The clay bakes hard you see, and
the heat cooks the chicken through and through.
When you come back you take out the clay ball
with the chicken for a center, crack it open, and
you dine sumptuously. That’s a clayed-chicken.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It sounds good,” said Natalie.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It is good,” declared Blake. “If you can get
a chicken over at the store, we’ll fix it for you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The girls voted to do so, and after putting the
clay vases in the firing pit, and having told the boys
of the scare of the night, they prepared for the trip
after supplies.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You can cook an elephant’s foot the same way,”
said Blake, seemingly appropros of nothing in particular,
as the boys and girls were walking up from
the lake shore to the grocery at the Point.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Kindly elucidate,” suggested Natalie.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I was thinking about the clayed chicken,” Blake
explained. “I read somewhere that they do elephant’s
feet the same way.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I should think it would hurt the elephants,”
remarked Marie innocently.</p>

<p class='c009'>“They don’t do it until the beasts have passed
beyond all pain and suffering,” went on Blake.
“Really, it’s said to be a delicious dish.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“We’ll have it for breakfast,” declared Jack.
“Phil, kindly get an elephant for our camp-cook.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“At once, your majesty,” replied Phil, with a
mock bow.</p>

<p class='c009'>The girls spent some time buying needful supplies,
as did the boys, for their stocks had run low.
There were some chickens to be had, a farmer having
brought in some fresh ones, and the girls decided
to let the boys experiment with the clay
method of cooking one.</p>

<p class='c009'>“But I’ll fricassee the other to make sure of
having a meal,” declared Mrs. Bonnell with a
laugh.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was just as the girls were getting ready to go
back in their two boats, and the boys were yet lingering
in the store, that Natalie uttered an exclamation.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What is it?” asked Marie.</p>

<p class='c009'>“That man—the constable who nearly arrested
me. There he is over by the rifle range. I’m going
to ask him if he has located that Gypsy girl yet.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, don’t, Nat!” exclaimed Mabel.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, I shall. I want to help get your mother’s
ring. The boys don’t seem able to find the encampment.
Perhaps we can,” and, before any one could
stop her, Natalie hurried along the dock to where
the constable was standing near a rifle range that
served to while away time for some of the campers.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mr. Jackson!” she exclaimed, “have you found
Hadee, the Gypsy, yet?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Hadee!” he exclaimed, startled. “Oh, I know
you now. You’re the girl I mistook for her. Well,
say, do you know I haven’t found them Gypsies yet!
I’ve been hunting all over for ’em, but—guess
they’ve skipped out. I’m on the track though. I’ll
let you know if I do locate ’em. Why, do you want
your fortune told?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, no!” Natalie exclaimed quickly. “We’ve
had all the fortune we want. We—we just want to
see their camp.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I guess you wouldn’t mind hearin’ your fortunes,”
murmured the constable. “Well, if I find
’em I’ll let you know,” and he nodded in a friendly
fashion.</p>

<p class='c009'>Rather disappointed, Natalie was going back to
the others who awaited her in the boat, when she
heard the captain of one of the lake steamers saying
to his engineer:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Say, where does that Italian chap want to get
off?” for all the steamers stopped at the Point as
a sort of half-way station, and continued on from
there.</p>

<p class='c009'>“He isn’t an Italian, he’s a Gypsy,” said the mate.
“I’ve seen him before. His tribe is stopping somewhere
in the woods near Bear Pond. He wants to
get off at Madison’s dock. All right. I’ve got a box
for there, too. All aboard!” and he hurried off.</p>

<p class='c009'>Natalie looked into the steamer, and saw a tall,
swarthy man sitting in the cabin. There were one
or two other passengers.</p>

<p class='c009'>“At Bear Pond!” she murmured. “There are
Gypsies at Bear Pond! Perhaps Hadee is there.
We must have a look, and we won’t tell the boys,
or Mr. Jackson.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Quickly she told her companions what she had
overheard.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Shall we try to find the camp?” she concluded.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes!” agreed Mabel eagerly. “Only I should
think that constable would know enough to inquire
of the boat captains about the Gypsies.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Probably it was so simple that it didn’t occur
to him,” said Mrs. Bonnell. “But I must consider
about letting you girls go off on this wild-goose
chase alone.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, you’d come with us; of course!” exclaimed
Marie. “I think it will be fun!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“So do I!” agreed Alice. “And we can take
along the ammonia gun, in case the dogs bark at us.
There are always a lot of dogs about a Gypsy
camp.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Wait a minute!” called Blake to the girls, as
they were rowing away. “We’ll go with you.
We’ve got some news for you!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Quickly he and his chums sent their craft up to
the boats containing the girls.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What’s the secret?” demanded Natalie.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We’re on the track of the Gypsies!” exclaimed
Jack. “They’re over on Mt. Harry, and we’re going
to trail them to-morrow. Isn’t that great?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But Natalie—” began Marie, when her chum
stopped her with a warning looking.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We’ll find out all we can for you,” went on
Phil, as none of the boys noticed Marie’s startled
exclamation. “And if it’s safe we’ll take you to
the camp later on. Mt. Harry is a nice place to go
to anyhow,” and he nodded in its direction—in a
direction directly opposite from Bear Pond.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We’ll go to the pond,” decided Natalie when
the boys had veered out of hearing. “And we’ll see
whether the Gypsies are there. Maybe we can get
ahead of the boys. Shall we go, girls?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes!” they chorused.</p>

    <div>LOST AT BEAR POND</div>

</div>

<p class='c008'>“Are you sure this is the road, Marie?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The man said it was.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That doesn’t make it so,” retorted Alice. “I
never knew such poor directions as those given by
persons who have lived in a place nearly all their
lives. You scarcely ever can depend on them.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That is so,” agreed Natalie. “I remember we
were at Atlantic Highlands one summer, and I went
for a walk. I got a little confused, and asked an
old gentleman how to get on the right road. He
was an old settler—he told me so—and yet he directed
me a mile out of my way, and it was twice
as far from where I was to our cottage as he said
it was. Oh, I was so provoked!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I do hope nothing like that occurs this time,”
ventured Mrs. Bonnell. “Whom did you ask about
the road, Marie?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The boy who brings our milk.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Not that stupid chap?” remonstrated Mabel.</p>

<p class='c009'>“He isn’t stupid,” declared Marie. “It’s only
bashfulness. He’s eighteen, and he ought to
know——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, he ought to know enough to be bashful
with this crowd,” laughed Alice. “Oh, Marie,
couldn’t you get any better guide?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“There you go!” exclaimed Jack’s sister. “You
left it all to me, and when I do get directions you’re
all finding fault. It isn’t fair!” and she swung
ahead on the narrow path as though she wanted to
have done with the argument.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was two days after Natalie had overheard what
she believed was a clue to the location of the Gypsy
camp, and the girls had determined, after a somewhat
lengthy consultation, to at least go near
enough to spy upon it, and decide later what to
do—perhaps with the help of the boys.</p>

<p class='c009'>Behold them now on their way to Bear Pond, a
rather lonesome bit of water about five miles back
in the woods from Green Lake. They had gone in
two boats to a certain cove whence ran a path, more
or less well defined, to the pond, and the talk now
ran on the chances of reaching their destination.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Though we may get there all right,” Natalie
asserted. “The question is—can we get back
again?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t see why not!” exclaimed Marie, who
had assumed the post of leader. “If you get to a
place you can always get back.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“This path seems to twist and turn so,” said
Alice, as they went single file along the winding
trail, that circled in and out among the trees, now
descending into a little glade, and again ascending
a slope. “If it will only stay crooked, and not
straighten out when we come back, maybe we can
remember it. Don’t you think we ought to make
some kind of landmarks as we go along, girls?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“We could blaze a trail,” suggested Natalie,
“only I don’t believe any one brought a hatchet.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, here’s one way not to forget,” said Mrs.
Bonnell. “There, breath-of-the-pine-tree, we’ll
know this white birch when we meet it again,” and
with a hairpin the Guardian began making a series
of zig-zag scratches on the white silver-like bark of a
sapling that stood along the path.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, don’t ever tell the boys you did that!”
gasped Marie.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why not?” Mrs. Bonnell wanted to know. “Is
it against the law to scratch a tree I’d like to ask?
That isn’t any worse that chipping it with a hatchet.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, but blazing a trail with hairpins!” gasped
Marie, laughing heartily. “What would the boy
scouts say? We might as well scatter side combs
along the trail, or take a skein of baby ribbon with
us, tying the loose end to our tent pole, and unreeling
it as we go along. Don’t tell the boys—Camp
Fire Girls blazing a trail with hairpins! Oh, dear!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t see but what it is just as good as when
done with a hatchet,” said Mrs. Bonnell, imperturbed.
“And you are far less likely to cut yourself.
I shall blaze our trail with hairpins, girls,
the accepted boy scout method to the contrary notwithstanding.”</p>

<p class='c009'>And she did, not heeding the laughter of the
girls. At every tree with a light-hued enough bark
to permit of it, she made her mystic scratches with
the hairpin points, sometimes drawing a fantastic
figure, Indian fashion, which further increased the
mirth of the girls.</p>

<p class='c009'>“How far did your bashful youth say it was?”
asked Mabel, after a pause, during which they
climbed a little rise, passing under great pine trees,
the needles of which made a slippery, brown, woodland
carpet beneath their feet.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, you’re coming to think that he wasn’t such
a bad guide after all then?” demanded Marie, a
trifle mollified.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I just want to see how nearly he can estimate
the distance,” was the answer.</p>

<p class='c009'>“He said it was five miles—five short ones,”
and Marie hastily corrected herself.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And the path a straight one?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, indeed. We have to turn to the right after
we pass the spring which is near the ruins of an
old house. Oh, I’ve got it all written down,” and
Marie began searching for the pocket of the short
brown skirt that with the middy-blouse, and low
shoes, formed the Camp Fire Girls’ outfit. A blank
look came over her face.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What’s the matter?” asked Natalie.</p>

<p class='c009'>“That paper—my directions. I wrote them
down on a slip of paper. I was sure I put it in my
pocket—I know I did—but now——”</p>

<p class='c009'>She turned the pocket inside out, but a handkerchief,
and a few other personal belongings, was all
that came to view.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Maybe it’s in with the lunch,” suggested Alice.</p>

<p class='c009'>They had brought along some sandwiches, and a
large bottle of olives, stuffed with Pimento peppers,
for they did not expect to get back to camp for
dinner. But an inspection of the several packets
into which the “eats”, as Alice called them, were
divided, disclosed no chart, map or other sailing
directions for locating the Gypsy camp.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Never mind!” exclaimed Marie. “I’m sure
I can find it without that. Reuben went over it
very carefully with me.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Reuben being the aforesaid bashful boy?”
asked Mabel.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes. And you needn’t make so much fun of
him, either. He’s real nice when you get to know
him, though he does say ‘yes, ma’am,’ and ‘no,
ma’am,’ to me, and he’s older than I am.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“How much?” inquired Natalie promptly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I sha’n’t tell! But come on if we’re going to
get to Bear Pond before noon,” and she quickened
her pace.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I wonder if the boys suspected where we were
going?” ventured Alice.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t believe so,” replied Mrs. Bonnell. “I
told them they mustn’t feel obliged to look after us,
or to accompany us everywhere we went. It was
very nice of them, I said, but we had come to the
woods to be real Camp Fire members, and didn’t
want to trouble them.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t believe they call it <i>trouble</i>,” said Marie.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Not as long as Natalie is along,” added Mabel.
“And we’re not a bit jealous, dear,” she added
quickly, as breath-of-the-pine-tree blushed. “You
may share all our brothers. Sometimes I wish some
one would take all of Phil. He’s such a tease when
he sets out to be!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I guess in this case they were glad not to be
asked to go anywhere with us to-day,” went on the
Guardian. “I didn’t so much as hint where we
were going—merely saying we might go for a row—which
we did. I rather think they had some plan
of their own they wanted to carry out. They took
their fish poles, but I didn’t hear them talking about
bait, which seems is hard to get here. So I
wouldn’t be surprised but what they were going to
Mt. Harry to look for the Gypsy camp that is really
at Bear Pond. They want to surprise us.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And we’re going to turn the tables!” exclaimed
Marie. “Won’t it be a joke!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“If we find the camp,” added Mabel.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Of course we will,” asserted the leader. “I
have all the directions down in my head.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“There’s another good tree to hairpin!” exclaimed
Mrs. Bonnell, as, with her useful little implement,
she again made her mystic scratches.
“We can’t help seeing that. Is it much farther,
Marie?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“We haven’t come to the spring yet, and it’s
a mile past that. But you’re not getting tired, are
you?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, no; only I wanted to know the worst.
Lead on—we will follow!” and she looked for
more trees to “blaze.”</p>

<p class='c009'>As the girls walked along, now taking little runs,
and experimental dashes on side paths, they broke
into song now and then, chanting, “Wo-he-lo for
Aye,” and other Camp Fire melodies; the “Walking
song,” and the gladsome rhyme of work.</p>

<p class='c009'>The way was a pleasant one. Since leaving the
little cove, where they had tied their boats, having
hidden the oars on shore, the path had been in a
most delightful glade, with occasional stretches of
meadow. Once they had encountered some cows,
and though at first debating the advisability of making
a detour, they had boldly crossed the field, the
bovines merely looking calmly at them, as if
wondering why humans did not lie down and chew
cuds when they had the chance.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What was that?” exclaimed Mabel, as a whirr
of wings, and the passage of some body through
the underbrush, startled her.</p>

<p class='c009'>“A quail,” answered Natalie. “I just got a
glimpse of it. Oh, see the lovely flowers!” and she
rushed over to a patch of ox-eyed daisies, or black-eyed-Susans,
and, pulling a bunch thrust them into
her belt, creating a decidedly picturesque effect.</p>

<p class='c009'>Marie pulled some maiden-hair ferns, and weaving
a chaplet as she walked along, dropped it on
Natalie’s head, for none of the girls wore hats.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, isn’t that sweet!” exclaimed Mabel.
“Wait, I must snap that!” and she posed Natalie
for her picture. Then they all had to be crowned
with ferns and “snapped”, after which a group
picture was taken, with them all sitting on a fallen
tree, Marie taking the group without herself in it
and then Natalie performing a like service for her
chum.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The spring and the ruins of the farmhouse at
last!” cried Marie, when another mile had been
covered. “We are almost there now.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then let’s eat here,” suggested Alice. “We
can get a drink, and olives always make me so
deliciously thirsty.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That’s what I say,” chimed in Marie, and then,
finding a little grassy spot they sat down tailor
fashion and ate.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s the best meal I’ve had in a week,” declared
Alice.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Are there any sandwiches left?” asked Mabel.
“That’s my best indorsement.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“One or two,” said Mrs. Bonnell. “Perhaps we
had better save them.” And to this the girls agreed.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then came a delicious period of rest under the
greenwood trees, while Natalie softly sang a song
of the sky-blue water, the others joining in the
chorus.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Forward, march!” cried Marie, a little later.</p>

<p class='c009'>“One moment!” exclaimed Mrs. Bonnell. “Another
tree to hairpin!” and she did her duty.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Which path?” asked Mabel, as they came to a
divergence of the ways. “Left or right, Marie?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Er—the—left!” hesitatingly pronounced the
leader.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Are you sure?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Positive.” And to the left they went.</p>

<p class='c009'>The way became more rocky and rugged—wilder—and
there were rather timid glances cast from left
to right as they passed through deep, dark and
silent glades, dark even with the bright sun shining
overhead.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I wouldn’t want to be lost here,” spoke Mabel
in a low voice.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Hush!” exclaimed Natalie. “Remember we
may get back your mother’s ring.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, I do hope so. But supposing these weren’t
the right Gypsies after all?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don’t you dare suggest such a thing!”
threatened Marie. “After all our work, running
away from the boys and all that. It simply <i>must</i> be
the right camp!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, I wish we’d come to Bear Pond,” sighed
Mrs. Bonnell. “Oughtn’t it to be near here,
Marie.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I think so,” and she seemed trying to recall the
directions.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why is it called Bear Pond?” Natalie wanted
to know.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Because there used to be bears there,” answered
Alice. “Why else?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Bur-r-r-r! I hope there are none about now,”
exclaimed Marie with a little shiver.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Nonsense!” came from Mrs. Bonnell.</p>

<p class='c009'>They scrambled up a rocky hill, saw before them
a little path leading off to the right, followed it and
came out on a sort of granite promontory. And
there, almost at their feet, lay Bear Pond.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was more desolate than they had imagined.
Not a house was to be seen, and only a leaky and
battered boat drawn up on shore near the rock told
that occasionally some one rowed on the water.
Blackened and decaying stumps could be seen here
and there, and across the tops of distant and dead
trees circled a few hoarse-voiced crows.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Talk of the Dead Sea!” murmured Natalie.
“This is it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It does remind one of that,” spoke Alice.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No wonder the Gypsies came here,” remarked
Mabel. “It is the most lonesome spot I ever saw.”</p>

<p class='c009'>They stood looking at the black and uninviting
water. Occasionally a fish moved in it, or leaped
for a fly that ventured too close to the surface. The
hoarse cawing of the crows added to the desolateness
of the scene. There was no sound save that of
the voices of the Camp Fire Girls.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Reuben said,” spoke Marie, “that few people
come here. There is good fishing at times—catfish
are plentiful, and there are lots of pond lilies. But
I’d never venture out on that water,” and she could
not repress a shudder.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Neither would I,” said Mabel. “I’d keep fearing
that a long, bony hand was about to reach up
from the depths and pull me down.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh!” screamed Natalie.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What is it?” demanded Mrs. Bonnell with a
little start.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Something—something moved.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“A bird in the bushes, likely. Silly! This place
is getting on the nerves of all of us, I guess. Marie,
can’t you locate the Gypsy camp, and then we’ll
go?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t know. Let’s follow this path. If we
don’t see their tents or wagons soon, we’ll go back.”</p>

<p class='c009'>They turned into a path that led down from the
rock around the desolate patch of water. It appeared
to have neither inlet nor outlet, and was
doubtless fed by springs from below, though it was
hard to imagine a pure spring bubbling up into those
black and murky depths.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t believe it’s here,” said Marie when they
had gone on for some distance. “Let’s go back!”</p>

<p class='c009'>No one opposed her, and there were sighs of
relief from all as they got back to the rock. Then,
with a look over the calm and dead surface of the
pond, they turned into the path again, while the
rasping voice of a crow, perched in a lightning-blasted
pine tree, seemed to laugh at their defeat.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Horrid creature!” murmured Natalie, and they
hurried on in silence.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Are you sure we came this way?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Where are some of those hairpin-blazed trees?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t remember this road.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And I’m sure we never passed this pile of
rocks!”</p>

<p class='c009'>The Camp Fire Girls came to a halt and looked
at one another. It was growing dusk, and they had
been walking away from Bear Pond for perhaps
half an hour. They thought they would soon be at
the cove where they had left their boats, but when
Mabel propounded that question, it raised doubts in
all their minds.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I think this is the way,” said Mabel.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Can’t you be sure?” asked Mrs. Bonnell, a bit
testily.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, it looks just like it, but why don’t we see
some of the trees you scratched?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That’s what I want to know,” put in Natalie.
“Let’s sit down and rest. Then we can think
better.”</p>

<p class='c009'>She fairly “slumped” down on the grass.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s damp there,” warned Mrs. Bonnell.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I can’t help it—I’m dead tired!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Marie walked off a little way. She went forward
on the path, and then retraced her steps. When she
rejoined her now silent chums there was the flush
of anxiety on her cheeks.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I—I don’t seem to remember this place,” she
began. “I guess we must have taken the wrong
turn some time ago. Let’s go back until we come
to two paths, and then take the other.”</p>

<p class='c009'>They retraced their steps, no one speaking much.
But they came to no divergence of the path. It
seemed to lead endlessly on through the woods, as
though generations of patient cows had plodded
their way along it. Marie who was in the advance,
halted.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Girls,” she said in a broken voice, “I—I don’t
see any use in keeping on. We’re only getting
more and more tangled.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Are we—lost?” asked Natalie in hesitating
tones.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I—I’m afraid so,” answered Marie.</p>

    <div>A NIGHT MARCH</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>“We must keep on!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, we can’t stay here in this lonesome place!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, if we could only see some house—and ask
our way.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I believe it’s going to rain—I felt a drop on my
nose.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Are you sure it wasn’t a tear, Natalie?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Thus talked the Camp Fire Girls as they gathered
in a group after Marie had admitted the dismal
failure to lead the way back from Bear Pond.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, though I do feel badly enough to cry,”
answered breath-of-the-pine-tree. “It’s really raining!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It can’t melt us,” declared Alice. “I only hope
it doesn’t thunder and lightning.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It won’t be that kind of a storm at all,” was
Mrs. Bonnell’s opinion. “It’s going to turn into a
miserable drizzle.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“My hair always curls in the wet,” cried Marie.
“That’s one consolation, anyhow.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You poor girl!” came from Alice. “Really
it’s no one’s fault that we got lost,” for Marie appeared
to think that she bore the responsibility of
leading her forces thus into <i>terra incognita</i>.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Of course not,” added Mrs. Bonnell. “It
couldn’t be helped. Now I want you all to be real
Camp Fire Girls!” she went on. “We must be
brave and loyal. This is only a little trouble. We
may be tired and wet but we’ve got to get back to
our tents sometime, and then we can thaw out, and
take enough hot lemonade to ward off colds. Now
I’m going to assume charge, and I’m going to give
orders. Wood-Gatherers, attention!”</p>

<p class='c009'>The girls stood up.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Get all the dry fuel you can,” ordered the
Guardian. “We are going to make a little fire, and
devour the remainder of our sandwiches. We’ll get
good and warm, rest, eat and then we’ll consider our
case. This is a good place for a fire, under the pine
tree. Come, No-moh-te-nah—Sweeper-of-the-tepee,”
she went on, addressing Alice, “you arrange
some seats for us. I’ll get out the lunch. The
others gather wood, and get some dried leaves to
start the fire.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Soon they were all busy, forgetting their troubles
in the gospel of work—the best secular gospel in
the world. A little later a cheerful blaze was
crackling under the wide-spreading branches of a
giant pine tree. For Mrs. Bonnell had a dependable
match box.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Isn’t this jolly,” exclaimed Natalie.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s really fun!” declared Marie.</p>

<p class='c009'>“If the boys could only see us now!” came from
Alice.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And hear about the hairpin-blazed trees that we
couldn’t locate after we scratched them,” added
Mabel.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Girls, if you ever tell on me I’ll never forgive
you!” insisted Mrs. Bonnell. “After this I’m going
to carry one of those boy-scout axes that fold up
into a sort of leather card case, and which can be
carried as a watch charm. Then I can chip off the
bark so we can see it at midnight. Only my sense
of proportion as one of the members of the society
for the conservation of forests prompted me to use
a hairpin.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Are there any more olives left?” asked Natalie.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes—a few, but they’ll make you dreadfully
thirsty, and we have only a little water,” answered
Mabel, for they had brought a little water in a bottle
from a spring they passed on their homeward
wanderings.</p>

<p class='c009'>They had been unable to find the path back to the
cove, after coming to the conclusion that they were
lost, and had come to a halt in a little glade, where
they had made the fire.</p>

<p class='c009'>The cheerful blaze did more than warm them,
for the summer rain was chilling. It put new hearts
into them, and made them more hopeful. Then too,
the little food they had remaining aided in the work
of regeneration.</p>

<p class='c009'>What though it be dusk, and they far from
camp—what though it rained? They had a fire,
they were warm and had been fed after a fashion.</p>

<p class='c009'>“‘Fate cannot harm me—I have dined to-day!’”
quoted Natalie. “Which is not saying that I could
not eat more,” she added, as she shook her long
braids to free them from the moisture that had
gathered as she collected the wood for the fire.</p>

<p class='c009'>“But we mustn’t stay here,” went on Mrs.
Bonnell after they had devoured—and I use the
word advisedly—the last crumbs of the sandwiches.
“We must keep on! We will simply have to find
a place to stay to-night—if we can’t get back to
camp. There must be farmhouses around here.
This isn’t a desert, and that boat at Bear Pond
showed that some one used it—even if it did leak.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don’t speak of Bear Pond!” pleaded Marie.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now, dearie, don’t you worry!” exclaimed
Alice, putting her arms around her chum. “It isn’t
any more your fault than ours. We should be more
like the boy scouts and ‘be prepared.’ That’s their
motto, you know.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But I lost the directions!” exclaimed Marie.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You couldn’t help it. Probably you pulled them
out of your pocket with your handkerchief, dear.
Don’t worry. We’ll get back to Dogwood Camp—someday.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m glad we brought stuffed olives instead of
those with pits in,” remarked Natalie.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why?” her chums chorused. Natalie was always
saying odd things, they thought.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Because there’s so much more meat to them.
The seeds are wasteful.”</p>

<p class='c009'>They laughed, and it seemed to make them feel
better. Then, with a warming of hands at the
blaze, they prepared to set out again.</p>

<p class='c009'>“This path must lead <i>somewhere</i>!” exclaimed
Mrs. Bonnell, as she and the girls carefully scattered
the embers of the fire, and kicked damp earth
on them to extinguish the brands. For they had
adopted some of the tenets of the boy scouts, one
of which is never to leave a burning camp fire to
work damage.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And if we keep on it long enough we must
come to some place!” declared Alice. “Even if
it’s only a cow-shed.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“This does seem like a cow-path,” declared
Natalie, “though it’s hard to tell what it is in the
dusk.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What—what are we going to do after dark?”
whispered Mabel.</p>

<p class='c009'>“March along with this!” cried Mrs. Bonnell,
flashing a small pocket electric lamp, operated by a
dry battery. It contained a tungsten filament, and
gave a glaring light, if it was limited as to area.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, you dear—to think of bringing that!” cried
Natalie. “I won’t be afraid now.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Afraid—what is there to be afraid of?” insisted
the Guardian, though it might be noted that
she looked rather fearsomely back of her as she
spoke.</p>

<p class='c009'>No one answered her.</p>

<p class='c009'>Once more they took up the march, as night
slowly settled down. There would be an hour or
more of rather dim daylight yet, for the days were
long, but the clouds made it more gloomy than
otherwise would have been the case.</p>

<p class='c009'>“There is a house!” suddenly called Marie.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Where?” they all demanded at once.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Right ahead of us. Oh, we’re all right now!”</p>

<p class='c009'>But it was not such a haven of refuge as they
had supposed. For the ram-shackle old building
was inhabited by an uncouth German, his wife
and several very much soiled children. He could
speak a little English—hardly enough to make himself
understood, and the German essayed by the
Camp Fire Girls was evidently beyond his comprehension,
for he shook his head in a puzzled fashion.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Where were they?”</p>

<p class='c009'>He knew not.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Which was the road to Green Lake?”</p>

<p class='c009'>He knew not.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Was there any one who did?”</p>

<p class='c009'>The same result.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Was there any one who could put them on the
right road?”</p>

<p class='c009'>No one. And the rain came down harder, while
it grew darker—seemingly more so in contrast to
the light that Mrs. Bonnell flashed to the no small
fear of the German <i>kinder</i>.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I suppose we might stay here until he could
go and get some one who could speak English, and
who could either show us where we have left our
boats, or take word to the boys to come after us,”
ventured Marie.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ugh! Stay here? Never!” cried Natalie.
“It’s so—so— Oh, it wouldn’t do at all!” she finished
with a real shudder. The others reluctantly
agreed with her.</p>

<p class='c009'>The man muttered something in his own language.
His wife replied, gesticulating and pointing
in several directions. Evidently she meant to
be of service but was unable to accomplish it. Then
the children cried for their suppers, and the girls,
feeling very lonesome and deserted, continued their
night march along the little path, the electric light
flashing like some modern firefly.</p>

    <div>“IT’S THE BOYS”</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>“How much farther?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I can’t walk another step!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You must! You can’t stay here—none of us
can! We must keep on!”</p>

<p class='c009'>The Camp Fire Girls were trudging through the
woods, whither the path led them—wet, miserable
and unhappy, yet not utterly discouraged. The little
pocket lamp of the Guardian was their salvation,
in a way, for the brilliant pencil of fire that
streamed out of the lens showed them the trail—such
as it was.</p>

<p class='c009'>They had hurried on from the rather inhospitable
farmhouse of the German—inhospitable not so
much from intention as misunderstanding.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, if we ever get to our dear, old camp
again!” murmured Marie, as she clung to Natalie’s
arm.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We’ll never go Gypsy-hunting again; will
we?” spoke Alice from the rear guard.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Never! I wonder if the boys had any better
luck?” asked Mabel.</p>

<p class='c009'>“At any rate they don’t mind being lost, and getting
wet,” said Marie.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, we’re not so wet,” voiced Natalie. “These
khaki suits are just dandy for shedding rain.
They’re like a duck’s back. Really, I’m not at all
damp—except outside.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But don’t you think we might have stayed
at that German place?” asked Mrs. Bonnell.
“Really, the farther on we go the more I worry
about you girls. Where <i>are</i> we going to come
out?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Somewhere on the shores of Green Lake,” declared
Mabel. “And if once we get there we can
surely find some one to help us. There are cottages
all around the lake, and it isn’t so late,
though it is dark. We can give our camp cry, when
we get a little nearer and some one will come out
to see what’s the trouble.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“When we get a little nearer what?” asked
Alice.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Green Lake,” replied Mabel. “If you’ll notice
we’ve been going down hill for the last ten minutes.
Green Lake lies lower than Bear Pond, and we
must be getting down to the lake level. Sooner or
later we’ll get to the shore, and then we won’t be
lost.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Fine!” exclaimed Mrs. Bonnell, as she clutched
at the arm of Mabel to save herself from falling,
having stepped on a stone that gave her ankle a
turn. “You are certainly pursuing knowledge,
Mabel—and that is one of our degrees. So you
really noticed that?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes. Going to Bear Pond we kept climbing
up—though of course there were times when we
had to go down in little glades. Now we are going
the other way, which shows that we are coming
down. Of course we may come out miles from
where we left our boats, but what matter—as long
as we are at the lake?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The dear, old lake!” murmured Marie. “I
shall be <i>so</i> glad to see it again.”</p>

<p class='c009'>They trudged on in the rain and darkness. The
drops were falling heavier now, for the drizzle had
given place to a regulation downpour with all the
accompaniments of wind and chilling atmosphere.
Fortunately the Camp Fire Girls had on heavy garments,
and their practical suits did really shed the
water-drops as does the proverbial duck’s back.</p>

<p class='c009'>The electric lamp served well to show them the
path, Mrs. Bonnell walking on ahead and flashing
the light at intervals, to keep herself from wandering
off the hard and beaten surface that seemed well-traveled
in spite of the lonesomeness of the surroundings.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It can’t be <i>much</i> farther!” murmured Natalie.
“I’m sure I’ve walked ten miles since we had the
last of the sandwiches!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don’t you dare mention eating!” cried Alice.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Are you tired?” asked Mrs. Bonnell, turning
back toward Natalie.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Not so very. But I do wish we were in camp.
Do you suppose the boys——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No such good luck!” interrupted Mabel, guessing
Natalie’s thought.</p>

<p class='c009'>“But if they come over to our camp, as they do
every evening,” went on breath-of-the-pine-tree,
“they’ll see that we aren’t there, and they may start
out——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, but how would they know where to
begin?” asked Marie. “We didn’t tell any one
where we were going!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Unless Reuben did.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That’s so!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Hope seemed to spring up anew.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, dear! oh!” suddenly called Alice.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What is it?” demanded Mrs. Bonnell, turning
and flashing her lamp.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don’t say it’s a snake!” begged Natalie.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t know what it was,” went on Alice.
“But something sharp pricked me on the ankle—right
through my shoe, too!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Mrs. Bonnell hurried back along the halted line.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Silly!” she cried. “Nothing but a piece of a
blackberry bush that slipped down inside your shoe.
Your lace is loosened.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh!” gasped Alice contritely. “I—I didn’t
mean to scare you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Once more they trudged on in the rain and darkness.
But to the eternal credit of the Camp Fire
Girls be it said that no one murmured. They all
recognized it as something that could not be helped
or bettered by complaining, and they were Spartan-like
in their sufferings, of which nerves played no
small part.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Let me carry the light for a while,” suggested
Marie to the Guardian.</p>

<p class='c009'>“All right, if you’d like to. Come up front,” invited
Mrs. Bonnell, who realized the need of letting
the girls do things for themselves.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh—Oh! Oh, dear!” gasped Marie as she
darted forward.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What is it now?” some one asked.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I stepped in a puddle—over my shoe! Oh,
isn’t it wet!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Water generally is,” said Natalie dryly.</p>

<p class='c009'>But Marie took the lead, and increased the pace,
which Mrs. Bonnell had been thinking of doing, but
from which she had refrained from suggesting as
she thought the girls were tired. But they responded
well to the quick-step that Marie led them.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Hark! What’s that?” suddenly exclaimed
Mabel, who was directly behind Marie.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What’s what?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That noise. Didn’t you hear some one calling?”</p>

<p class='c009'>They halted—hearts beating so hard that it
seemed as if they might be heard by others than the
owners.</p>

<p class='c009'>From the blackness around them came a shout.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Haloooooo!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“An owl!” murmured Natalie.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Maybe a bat,” ventured Alice.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, you horrid thing! Don’t mention bats!”
begged Mabel.</p>

<p class='c009'>Again came the long-drawn out cry:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Hallo-o-o-o-o!”</p>

<p class='c009'>The girls drew closer together, Mrs. Bonnell extending
the lamp as some sort of weapon.</p>

<p class='c009'>“That German,” murmured Alice.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We’re miles away from his place,” whispered
Marie.</p>

<p class='c009'>From the woods in front of them came a crashing
as of some heavy body breaking through the
underbrush.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, dear!” sighed Natalie.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Maybe,” began Alice, “maybe it’s——”</p>

<p class='c009'>She was interrupted by another hail. Then came
the challenge:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Stony Point! Camp Fire Girls! Crystal
Springs!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Wo-he-lo! Wo-he-lo!” shouted Natalie with
all the strength of her splendid lungs.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Wo-he-lo!” came in answer.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s the boys!” screamed Alice. “Oh, it’s the
boys! Now we are all right!”</p>

    <div>THE BOTTLE OF OLIVES</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>“Did you come to look for us?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“How did you know where we were?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, but we’re <i>so</i> glad to see you!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“How far is it to camp? We’re almost dead!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Girls! Girls! Do restrain yourselves a little!
We are not half so badly off as that!”</p>

<p class='c009'>It was Mrs. Bonnell who uttered the last, and
Natalie, Marie, Alice and Mabel who, in turn, gave
voice to the other expressions, following the gladsome
cry of Alice that she had heard the boys. And
she really had.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Camp Fire Girls ahoy!” yelled Jack, as he and
his chums came a little nearer.</p>

<p class='c009'>“However did you find us?” demanded Natalie,
as the three came running along the path through
the halo of misty light caused by the refraction of
the Guardian’s electric torch on the raindrops.</p>

<p class='c009'>“By the process of deduction!” said Phil, as he
gave his sister’s hand a quick pressure, and then—pressed
that of some one else. No, there’s no use in
asking whose it was. Besides Phil often changed—as
did Jack and Blake, for all the girls had hands
that were temptations to hold.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t see how you knew we were here,” went
on Mabel, as, after some hysterical laughter they
resumed their way.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Old Hanson told us he saw you coming over
this direction in boats,” explained Blake, “and we
put two and three together and got six. Then, by
subtracting one we knew you five were over here
and we came.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, how glad we are!” exclaimed Natalie.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And is it far to the lake?” inquired Alice. “It
seems as if we must have walked ten miles.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The cove where you left your boats is about a
quarter of a mile away,” explained Jack. “You’d
have been there in about five minutes if you had
kept on.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“We were about to give up,” declared Natalie.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We can never row back,” added Mabel.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You won’t have to,” declared her brother.
“We have the motor-boat, and we can leave your
boats here until to-morrow.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It would be hard to find where we hid the oars,
anyhow,” suggested Marie, fearing lest the boys
would insist on towing the craft. “You haven’t, by
any chance, anything to eat; have you?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Nary an eat!” confessed Blake. “We came
off in such a hurry.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Where did you go?” asked Mabel, as if she
did not know.</p>

<p class='c009'>“To Mt. Harry,” explained Jack. “You see we
heard that the Gypsy camp was over there, and we
thought we could get on the track of that girl!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Did you?” asked Mrs. Bonnell innocently,
nudging Marie under cover of the darkness.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No. There wasn’t the sign of a camp. But
what did you go to Bear Pond for?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“How did you know we were at Bear Pond?”
challenged Natalie.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Because that’s the only place to go to on this
road, or from this part of the lake. Every one goes
to Bear Pond who comes over this way. So, when
we got back, and went over to your camp, and found
you weren’t home by supper time,” explained Jack,
“we knew where you’d gone.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And we knew you were lost,” added Phil.</p>

<p class='c009'>“How?” Mabel wanted to know.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Because every one who goes to Bear Pond the
first time gets lost,” declared Blake. “Don’t they,
fellows?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Sure,” came the chorus.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why did you go without telling us?” asked
Jack. “We could have shown you the road, and—”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh-o-o-o-o!” suddenly screamed Mabel.
“Look!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What is it? A snake?” asked Jack, springing
to her side.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, but I saw two green eyes— Oh! how they
glittered! On the path right in front of us!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“A skunk, maybe!” volunteered Blake.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, you horrid thing!” came in five different
intonations of feminine voices.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, maybe it was only a ’coon, or ’possum,”
admitted Blake. “He was probably attracted by
Mrs. Bonnell’s light.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then I’ll put it out!” declared the Guardian,
who had kept the spring switch of her pocket electric
torch pressed down, thus making a continuous
light.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, don’t,” begged Blake. “We came off in
such a hurry that we didn’t bring a lantern, and the
path isn’t any too plain. They won’t hurt you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I know—but—skunks——” hesitated Mrs.
Bonnell.</p>

<p class='c009'>“They’re as harmless as cats. Come on!” and
resolutely Blake pressed forward. The two green
spots had disappeared, and by the time the excitement
had calmed down Jack’s question had been
forgotten, to the relief of the girls, who did not
want to answer unless they had to.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Next time don’t try to find Bear Pond unless
one of <i>us</i> goes along,” suggested Jack in patronizing
tones.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, but we did find it,” declared Mabel. “It
was after we found it, and on our way home, that
we got lost. The hairpin blazing didn’t work.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The what?” cried Blake in curiosity.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mabel, if you mention that I’ll never forgive
you!” threatened Mrs. Bonnell.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Go on; tell!” urged Phil. “Hairpin blazing?
What is that; a new kind of Camp Fire Girls’
stunt?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don’t you tell!” warned the Guardian, and
with laughter the girls refused.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, we’ll find out!” the boys threatened.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We’ll go over the same trail to-morrow,” added
Jack.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then it will be time enough to tell you,” remarked
Mrs. Bonnell calmly.</p>

<p class='c009'>A little later they were at the cove, and safely in
the motor-boat, puffing across the lake, the red and
green lights making shimmering jewels in the water.
It was raining quite hard now, but the boys had
some pieces of tarpaulin, with which the engine was
covered nights, since there was no boat house.
These stiff canvases the girls used to put over their
shoulders, though they were pretty well wet through
as it was.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, be it ever so cheerless there’s no place like
camp!” cried Mabel, as they reached the place of
the tents. “I’m nearly starved.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, you girls just get some dry things on,”
directed her brother, “and we’ll make a ripping old
fire, and have tea for you in a jiffy. Where do you
keep the grub, anyhow?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’ll show you,” said Mrs. Bonnell, and soon the
boys, with occasional laughter and gibes at the girls,
were making a simple meal ready, while the camp
fire, built from some wood stored under a strip of
canvas to keep it dry, sent out its cheerful blaze.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, and to think how miserable we were an
hour ago!” sighed Natalie as she sipped the tea
and ate some cakes, which, in lieu of sandwiches,
the boys had served.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It was lovely of you to come for us,” said
Marie. “And you didn’t find the Gypsies after
all?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No; I don’t believe they’re even in this neighborhood,”
declared Blake. “If they were they
skipped out since the pocket-book was taken. Have
some more tea, Mrs. Bonnell?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“A half cup, if you please. It’s really delicious.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, we can make tea, even though we seldom
drink it,” declared Jack. “Coffee is our main
standby.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The girls, in dry garments, soon forgot the discomforts
of the trip to Bear Pond, and a little later,
after a session of sitting under a heavy-foliaged pine
tree, that kept off the rain, while a fire blazed cheerfully
beneath it, the boys went to their own tents,
and the girls prepared for the night.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Let’s go fishing!” proposed Marie to her
chums the next day, and as they knew something
of the art so delightfully described by Mr. Izaak
Walton, and were not afraid to bait hooks, the
Camp Fire Girls were soon out on the lake in their
two rowboats, heading for a quiet cove, where the
boys had said some fine pickerel and perch
abounded.</p>

<p class='c009'>A “clay chicken” had been decided on for dinner
that day the girls having found that this method
of preparing the fowl was most excellent. It had
been put in the hole in the ground, and covered with
embers before the fishing party had started off.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It will be done when we get back,” decided
Marie, who was cook that day, “and there will be
enough left over for supper.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What will we do with our fish?” asked Mabel.
“We haven’t much ice, and they won’t keep,” for
the ice boat left a supply occasionally at the camps
and cottages of the lake.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We can give them to the boys, or to Mr. Rossmore,”
said Natalie.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Let’s wait and see if we catch any,” suggested
Mrs. Bonnell with a laugh.</p>

<p class='c009'>The girls did have fairly good luck, though
Natalie lost what she declared was the biggest
perch in the lake, it not being well-hooked, and getting
off just as she raised it from the water. Indeed
they did have so many fish, that, what with the
“clay chicken” they did not need them all for food.
And after the boys had cleaned the catch, some
were given to themselves, and the rest to Reuben,
whose directions had enabled the girls to get lost
coming from Bear Pond. He said he would give
some to the old hermit of the mill.</p>

<p class='c009'>“But indeed it wasn’t his fault that we took the
wrong path,” said Natalie.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, I guess every one who goes to Bear Pond
the first time has the same experience,” added
Marie. “I know I heard a number of campers
say the same thing. There are too many cow-paths.”</p>

<p class='c009'>They had nearly finished dinner, some time later,
the “clay chicken” being done to a turn, when
Natalie remarked:</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m going to get some olives. I set out a bottle
to put on the table, but I forgot them. Have
some, girls?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Surely!” exclaimed the others.</p>

<p class='c009'>Natalie disappeared into the cooking tent where
some of the supplies were kept, and came back
quickly, exclaiming:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Who took them?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What?” asked Mrs. Bonnell.</p>

<p class='c009'>“That bottle of olives. I left them, all ready to
serve, on the box of canned things that we haven’t
opened yet. Now they’re gone.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The boys——” began Alice.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Haven’t been here,” declared Natalie. “They
have gone to Mt. Harry again, or somewhere else,
trying to locate the Gypsy camp.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Perhaps you didn’t put the olives there,” suggested
Mabel.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m sure——” began Natalie, and then as the
others came to the tent to help her look, she added:</p>

<p class='c009'>“And the corkscrew is gone, too, and a can of
sardines! I left them all together here on the box,
intending to open the olives, and now they’re gone.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Were you going to open the sardines, too?”
asked Mrs. Bonnell.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, Jack asked me for them; he said he’d call
this afternoon. They haven’t any in camp. Girls,
some one has been here taking our things!” and
Natalie looked tragically at her companions.</p>

    <div>A SHARP ATTACK</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>“Natalie Fuller! Don’t you dare say such
things!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The idea of any one being at our camp!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I sha’n’t sleep a wink to-night!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t believe you left the olives and other
things out at all—you’ve made a mistake.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Thus did the chums of breath-of-the-pine-tree try
to refute her statement.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Are you sure, Natalie?” asked Mrs. Bonnell.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Positive,” was her answer.</p>

<p class='c009'>“She wouldn’t be likely to forget if Jack asked
her to do anything,” declared Marie with a laugh.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I thought it was Blake,” said Mabel.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Stop it!” demanded Natalie with a stamp of
her small foot, encased in a boating shoe, while the
red surged up under her olive coat of tan. “Some
one <i>has</i> been here!” she added.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, and a can of peaches is gone!” declared
Mrs. Bonnell, looking along an improvised shelf,
where some canned goods had been set. “I remember
noticing that there was one on the very end of
the row,” she continued, “and now it is missing.
Some one has been taking liberties with our camp.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Tramps,” suggested Mabel.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Gypsies,” declared Natalie. “Oh, dear! I
hope they won’t come around after dark.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“How can you suggest such things?” demanded
Mrs. Bonnell. “Stop!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“We must tell the boys,” remarked Marie, and
a little later, the meal being finished a flag was run
up on a pole near the lake shore. It was easily observable
from the point where the boys camped, and
was an adopted signal requesting the presence of
the three chums at Crystal Springs.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, what is it this time?” asked Jack as he
and his companions arrived a little later. “Has
old Jackson been trying to arrest you again for
scaring some one’s cows?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Nonsense,” declared his sister. “This is more
serious. Boys, we’ve been——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Nothing is more serious than scaring cows,”
insisted Jack. “If you make them run they’ll give
milk instead of butter.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then I should think it would save the farmers
the bother of churning,” was Mabel’s opinion, at
which they all laughed.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What is up?” asked Blake, seeing that the
girls looked worried.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Some one has been taking our things,” said
Mrs. Bonnell. “A bottle of olives, some sardines——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The ones you asked me for, Jack,” put in Natalie.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Look here!” cried Marie, as she detected a grin
on the faces of Blake and Phil, “you boys have
been taking stuff; haven’t you? Own up now, if
you have. We’ll forgive you, for we don’t want
to have to worry; and, really, it’s enough to make
any one nervous.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Not guilty,” answered Phil.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We have committed many sins,” replied Blake,
with mock-heroics, “but far be it from us to rob
the helpless. So, Master Jack, you have been soliciting
alms in the shape of sardines; hast thou?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, for you duffers don’t like ’em, and
wouldn’t buy any. I offered to pay Nat for a can,
only——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, you’re welcome to them, I’m sure,” said
Mrs. Bonnell. “We were only thinking that perhaps
you came over here while we were away
and——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, we didn’t,” said Blake, and he spoke so
seriously that there was nothing for it but to believe
him. “Just what happened?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You tell him, Nat,” urged the other Camp
Fire Girls and Natalie did.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Doesn’t it look as though some one was here?”
she finished, twisting the silver ring on her finger—the
ring with the symbol of the seven fagots.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It certainly does,” agreed Blake. “We’ll take
a look around,” and he started down to the shore
of the lake.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What good will that do?” asked Phil. “Do
you think you can spot their feetsteps?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I might,” answered Blake coolly. “All the
girls wear rubber-soled shoes, as we do, and if some
stranger came to camp he might have on other
kind of coverings. They would show in the soft
ground. You take a look back where the road
comes in,” he advised.</p>

<p class='c009'>“There might be something in that,” admitted
Jack. “Come on, Phil,” and the three were soon
scanning the ground about the camp while the
girls, rather disturbed by the information that had
come to them, finished clearing away the lunch
dishes.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It won’t be safe to go away after this,” said
Mabel.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Not unless we lock up our best things,” added
Alice.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You can’t lock a tent,” declared Marie.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, but we can our trunks. Oh, the boys have
found something!” she suddenly cried, as excited
voices came from some little distance away from
the tents where the three chums had gone.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don’t you hit that!” Jack could be heard to
yell.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, leave it alone!” insisted Blake.</p>

<p class='c009'>There was the crash of a stone through the treetops.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, they’re having a fight!” screamed Mabel.
“Some one has attacked them!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Your ammonia gun—quick!” begged Natalie.
“Oh, Mrs. Bonnell!”</p>

<p class='c009'>The Guardian made a rush for the sleeping tent.
There came a chorus of yells from the boys and
then a series of crashing sounds that told of hasty
flight through underbrush.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Not that way! Not that way!” yelled Blake.
“Do you want to lead ’em to the girls!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t care where I lead ’em, as long as they
let me alone!” answered Phil. “Wow! One got
me that time!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Hurry! Hurry with that ammonia pistol!”
besought Natalie, looking to where the boys were
running about, wildly waving their hands over
their heads.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What did you want to hit it for?” shouted
Jack. “I told you what it was!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But I didn’t think it was,” answered Phil, as he
dodged here and there.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What is the matter? Oh, what is the matter?”
screamed Mabel. “Are they after you?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“They sure are,” declared her brother. “We’ve
stirred up a hornets’ nest! Get in the tent and
stay there until they calm down. Wow!” he
yelled. “One bit me then!”</p>

<p class='c009'>The boys were wildly rushing about, while there
was a curious humming sound in the air. The girls
gave one look, saw a number of insects flying
everywhere, and then hurried into the main tent,
pulling the flaps after them.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Get in the water!” yelled a new voice. “Run
for the lake and duck! That’s the only way to
get rid of ’em!”</p>

<div class='chapter'>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c007'>
    <div>ANOTHER TRY</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>The boys did not stop to see who gave the advice.
It seemed good to follow, and they did. Regardless
of their clothes, which were of light weight,
easily dried, they ran toward the lake, wading in
until it was deep enough to duck under.</p>

<p class='c009'>As for Blake, he did not wait for that, but, wildly
brushing his hands about his head, in he plunged,
face foremost as soon as the water was up to his
knees. And his head went well under.</p>

<p class='c009'>“That’s the only way to get rid of hornets when
they once take after you,” went on the voice of
one who had given the good advice. “They can’t
sting under water.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The girls peered from the tent to see approaching
one Reuben—his other name they had never
asked. He worked for a near-by farmer, and
had often brought butter, eggs and occasionally
chickens, when the campers did not get them from
the regular storekeepers.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, look how Reuben is dressed up!” exclaimed
Mabel.</p>

<p class='c009'>“He must be going to the circus, or somewhere,”
added Alice.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Probably he’s going to the ‘city’, wherever
that is up here,” declared Marie. “Oh, but look
at Jack!”</p>

<p class='c009'>The three chums, after floundering about in the
water, had now ventured to raise their heads, but
Jack appeared not to have quite freed himself of
the pestiferous insects so rudely disturbed, and
after getting a needful breath of air he had to duck
under the water again.</p>

<p class='c009'>Blake had reached a deep place and was swimming
down the lake, making rather slow progress
because of his clothes. He came presently to a little
point, swam in until his feet could touch bottom,
and then, cautiously waiting to see if any of the
hornets were about, and hearing none, ventured to
go ashore.</p>

<p class='c009'>Phil, too, had managed to get rid of his guard
of honor, and was approaching the little gravelly
beach. But Jack seemed to have more than his
share.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’ll fix you for this, Phil, when I——” he began,
and then he had to get beneath the water
again.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Swim up the shore a bit, duck down and I guess
they’ll leave you,” called Blake, and Jack, catching
at least the drift of the advice, if not all the words,
did so. Soon three dripping figures stood on shore,
cautiously listening for the hum of the hornets’
wings.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I—I guess they’re gone,” said Phil slowly, as
he looked at a rapidly swelling wrist.</p>

<p class='c009'>“They ought to,” said Blake. “The next time
you throw a stone at a hornets’ nest we’ll make
you stay and apologize. I’m stung in half a dozen
places!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“So am I,” declared Jack. “What’s good for
the bites?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“They don’t bite, they sting,” Reuben informed
them as he tied the boat in which he had arrived,
and walked up to the tents. “If they’ve left their
stinger in it’s worse, too.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“How do you tell that?” Jack wanted to know.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You rub your finger over the place, and if it
hurts more than when you don’t rub it, and if it
feels like there was a sliver in it, that’s the sting.
Or you can see it with a magnifying glass. I
worked for a feller once that kept bees, and I got
stung regular. They say it’s good for rheumatism,”
he added cheerfully.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Give me the rheumatism,” said Blake as he tenderly
felt of a swelling on his cheek. “Say, maybe
they didn’t come for us!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Are they gone?” demanded Natalie, peering
from between the tightly-held tent-flaps.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Pretty much,” replied Jack. “Cæsar’s pineapples!
How they hurt though!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Be careful, girls,” cautioned Mrs. Bonnell. But
a little observation told them that the hornets had
gone back to repair the damage done by Phil’s
stone thoughtlessly tossed into their nest.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What do you do for the stings?” asked Blake
of the farm lad.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I always puts mud on ’em.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ammonia is better,” volunteered Mrs. Bonnell.
“Wait and I’ll get you boys some. I have a bottle
of the strongest kind for my little pistol.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I wish we’d had that when they came at us,”
murmured Phil, clasping a wrist that was rapidly
getting to be twice its natural size.</p>

<p class='c009'>The ammonia made the stings feel a little less
painful, and then the boys went back to their camp
to don dry clothes.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I wonder if they found any evidence of those
who have been helping themselves to things in our
camp?” observed Natalie, as she and her companions
left the large tent.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We’ll ask them later,” said Marie.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Have you folks been missing things?” asked
Reuben, as he overheard the talk.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes,” answered Alice, “Whom do you think
could have taken the stuff?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s them Gypsies!” declared Reuben. “Lots
of folks around here are complainin’ of missing
things. Not only the farmers but some cottagers
and campers. Them Gypsies ought to be driven
away. They’re a regular nuisance comin’ here
every year.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But where are they?” asked Mabel.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Over at Bear Pond, some one told me. Did you
girls find it that day all right?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, yes—we <i>found</i> it,” answered Marie, for
they had agreed that they would not needlessly admit
their failure to select the right road home.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And did you see ’em?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No,” answered Mrs. Bonnell. And then, wishing
to change the conversation she asked:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Where are you going, Reuben, with your good
clothes on?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Nowheres,” and he blushed painfully.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, you must be going somewhere,” she insisted,
for he seemed but a little boy.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, I jest took half a day off and come over
to see you folks,” he went on, and this time his ears
were included in the general red color scheme of his
face.</p>

<p class='c009'>“That was nice of you,” went on the Guardian,
while the girls tried hard not to giggle. “Won’t
you sit down?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, ma’am. I thought maybe some of you girls
would like to come for a row,” and he motioned to
a small, and not altogether water-tight boat that
he had moored near the little dock.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We can’t all get in that boat, Reuben,” said
Marie.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No ma’am, I—er—I only thought of taking
<i>one</i>!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Reuben fussed with his straw hat, while the
girls, after a first gasp of surprise, looked at
each other.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Which—<i>one</i>—Reuben?” asked Mrs. Bonnell
softly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, I ain’t particular!” he answered with
cheerful indifference. “You could draw lots for
it if you was a-minded to. Or you can take turns
if you want. I kin git half a day off onct a week
I guess.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That’s very kind of you,” said Mrs. Bonnell,
while Natalie had to stuff her handkerchief in her
mouth, and Marie and Mabel suddenly discovered
that they had something vitally important in the tent
that must be fetched immediately.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I—I’m afraid we can’t come now, Reuben,”
said Mrs. Bonnell gently. “You see we have to do
our after-lunch work, and then we have other
things to do. Some other time——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’ll come any time you want me,” he said eagerly.
“Jest let me know a day ahead so’s I kin git
off, and I’ll come. I’ll take anybody out,” he added
cheerfully. Then, bringing one hand from behind
his back where he had kept it during the talk, he
held out some wild flowers and ferns.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I brought these,” he said. “You kin have ’em,”
and he thrust them toward Natalie, who had returned
from the tent where she had mastered her
near-hysterics.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, thank you!” she exclaimed, as she slipped
them in her belt. “They are very pretty.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, I kin git heaps more,” he said with proper
indifference. “I guess I’ll go over and see how
the boys’ stings is comin’ on,” he added. “And
I’ll take you rowin’ any time you like—one at a
time. Maybe you’d want to go to Bear Pond agin,”
he added. “I’ll row you as far as we kin go, and
we’ll walk the rest of the way.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Not now, thank you,” said Mrs. Bonnell.
“We’ll think about it,” and Reuben walked off
toward the boys’ camp.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, oh, Natalie!” laughed Marie, when he
was out of hearing.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It was you he favored last time!” declared
breath-of-the-pine-tree, as she re-arranged her
flowers. “And really he meant to be kind.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Of course!” exclaimed Mrs. Bonnell. “But,
girls, he has given me an idea. Now you know we
are going to stay here for some time longer,” and
she looked around at them.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What about it?” asked Marie, as the Guardian
paused.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, it isn’t very pleasant to feel that every
time you leave the camp some one is likely to come
in and take things. It spoils all the fun.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Indeed it does,” agreed Mabel. “But what
can we do?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“If the Gypsies are really to blame,” went on
Mrs. Bonnell, “then they should be warned to keep
away from here. Why can’t we send word to that
constable who so nearly arrested Nat?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“We can,” said Alice. “But he couldn’t seem to
find the Gypsies himself, and neither the boys nor
ourselves have had any better luck.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I was going to say we might make another try
at Bear Pond,” resumed the Guardian. “We know
the road now, and we won’t get lost. Suppose we
have a second try. We don’t need to tell the boys,
except that we are going off for a row and walk.
I would like to know that our camp was safe when
we leave it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What about leaving it to look for the Gypsies?”
asked Marie.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, we would have to take one chance of
course.”</p>

<p class='c009'>They talked it over, and ere the boys had come
back with their dry clothing the Camp Fire Girls
had decided that they would make another try to
locate the suspected Gypsies.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We might take Reuben for an escort,” suggested
Natalie.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh-o-o-o!” came in a long-drawn-out chorus.
“Oh-o-o-o Nat!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, then, our boys!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, let’s see if we can’t do this all ourselves,”
suggested Marie. “Remember that we are—Camp
Fire Girls!”</p>

    <div>THE GYPSY CAMP</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>“Have we everything we need?” asked Natalie.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, and we wouldn’t even if we had brought
the whole camp outfit with us,” replied Marie.
“We’d still find that we wanted something we
didn’t have.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But we have enough!” declared Mrs. Bonnell,
looking at what she carried, and then at the
burdens borne by the girls. It was two days after
the episode of the hornets, and the members
of Dogwood Camp had sallied forth to make
another effort to locate the Gypsies. And, to
prevent a repetition of their unfortunate experience
the previous time, they were well equipped, as will
presently be set forth.</p>

<p class='c009'>They had managed to conceal from the boys their
real destination, by a harmless little subterfuge
that it is needless to recite. Sufficient to say that
it was rendered all the more easy because the boys
had a ball game in prospect—two nines made up of
cottagers and campers—and they were to play at a
certain distant and fashionable hotel.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Which means that they will be away late
enough so that they won’t have to come to rescue
us,” said Mabel.</p>

<p class='c009'>“There will be no need this time,” asserted Mrs.
Bonnell. “I have the little axe with which to blaze
the trees.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It sounds like a French lesson, doesn’t it?”
asked Alice, with a laugh.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The hairpins did very well,” said Natalie with
another laugh, at the remembrance of their pretty
Guardian-chaperone diligently scratching the bark
of the white birch trees with her wire coiffeur retainers.</p>

<p class='c009'>The day after the boys had “played tag with the
hornets,” as Alice put it, there had been rain, but
the Camp Fire Girls had put in the enforced idle
time to good advantage by getting ready for the
trip to Bear Pond.</p>

<p class='c009'>Marie had artfully interviewed Reuben when
he came with some eggs, and had carefully jotted
down the directions to be followed. He told them
of a shorter route to the place, necessitating a little
longer row, but less of a walk.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then they had carefully packed some baskets of
provisions, and had even arranged to take along
some coffee, and an old pot in which to boil it over
an open fire.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, I guess we’re ready to start,” announced
Mrs. Bonnell, after an early breakfast.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Did you bring the compass?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“How many bottles of olives did you put in?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I hope there are enough sandwiches.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And a drinking cup.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What about matches?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Did you lock my trunk, Natalie?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What shall we do with the keys?”</p>

<p class='c009'>The above are only samples. Three or more
pages of similar import might be set down, but to
no purpose. They were about to leave their camp,
and, against the visits of an intruder they had
locked most of their valuables such as they did not
take with them—in their trunks. Then the tent-flaps
had been carefully tied shut, a weird array
of knots being used, having been copied from a
boy-scout book that the Guardian had with her.</p>

<p class='c009'>“If a burglar can untie those,” said Mrs. Bonnell
as she finished the last one, “he’ll be so short
tempered that he won’t bother to take the few little
things we have left here.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But how can we untie them?” asked Marie.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, I can easily pick them out with a hairpin,”
answered the resourceful Mrs. Bonnell. “Hairpins
to a woman are what a screw-driver is to a man. I
never could get along without them. From buttoning
shoes to opening bottles of olives, they run the
gamut of utility.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The day was fair, with no promise of rain, but,
even if it should come, the serviceable suits, of
which each girl had two, would neither be damaged,
nor would they readily permit of the wearers being
drenched.</p>

<p class='c009'>And so they started off.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I do hope that Reuben doesn’t tag after us,
or want to come with us,” said Alice, when they
were in the boats.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why, did he say he would?” asked Mabel.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, but he was rather hinting when we questioned
him about Bear Pond. I wouldn’t be surprised
but what he got one of his ‘half days off,’
and became our escort.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“He means all right,” murmured Natalie.
“Poor fellow!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You may well say that, if you accept any more
flowers from him,” warned Alice.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t see why. They are only wild blossoms,
and I’d pick them myself if he didn’t.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That’s Nat!” exclaimed Mabel with a laugh.</p>

<p class='c009'>They rowed leisurely to another cove about
which Reuben had told them, and then, once more
concealing the oars, they struck off into a path that,
they had been assured led directly to Bear Pond,
and to that portion most likely to be the camping-place
of the Gypsies, since it was near a main-traveled
road.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Be sure we have everything!” exclaimed Alice,
as they disembarked. “For it may be a long time
before we get back.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don’t look for trouble,” warned Mrs. Bonnell.</p>

<p class='c009'>Laden with their parcels and bundles containing
mostly food, for they intended to have a substantial
lunch in the woods, they trudged on. Mrs. Bonnell
industriously blazed the trail as they proceeded,
though it was scarcely necessary, for the path
seemed often used.</p>

<p class='c009'>“But we may be able to see the white blaze
of the wood in the dark,” she insisted.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, if we could only bribe a few lightning bugs
to stay on each chipped-off place,” suggested Marie,
“we could easily pick out the path then.”</p>

<p class='c009'>They laughed at her quaint conceit, and proceeded.
The way was easier than the first one they
had essayed, and they made better time. In the
distance they had occasional glimpses of farmhouses
set down in some hollow. Farmhouses of an ancient
régime, it seemed, since the land about them
was little tilled now. There were only small gardens,
not prolific ones at that.</p>

<p class='c009'>They came from the path out upon a country
road, with many and deep ruts in its dirt surface.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We are to keep along this for half a mile, and
then take the path to the right,” read Marie from
the written directions that had not been forgotten
this time.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, there’s an old well sweep, and I’m sure
there must be an old oaken bucket going with it!”
cried Mabel. “I must have a drink,” and she
started toward the gate of a farmhouse they were
approaching.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The germ-covered bucket!” murmured Alice.
“I’d rather have a tin pail.”</p>

<p class='c009'>As they reached the gate a yellow cur rushed
out at them, barked vociferously and interspersing
his disapproval with snarls of anger.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, mercy!” cried Natalie, shrinking back.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Good doggie! Good old fellow!” called Mrs.
Bonnell, coming to a standstill, while the girls huddled
behind her. “Nice old chap!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“He isn’t at all nice!” declared Alice. “How
can you say such things?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That’s always the way to talk to barking dogs,”
insisted the Guardian. “Don’t let them see that
you fear them.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No—don’t!” laughed Natalie, as she saw the
fear-huddled group. “We are a living monument
to—bravery!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Maybe his bark is worse than his bite,” whispered
Mabel.</p>

<p class='c009'>The dog did not seem disposed to retreat. He
had run out into the road, and disputed their progress,
in spite of the many soothing “good-doggie!”
and “Nice old fellow!” verbal sops that
Mrs. Bonnell threw to him.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Maybe he’s hungry!” suggested Marie. “Wait
a minute!”</p>

<p class='c009'>She began exploring the lunch basket she carried
and presently threw something to the cur.
He made a spring for it, and then bolted into the
yard.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why, Natalie Fuller!” cried Alice aghast.
“That was one of our best chicken sandwiches!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You didn’t think I’d give him anything but
the best; did you?” inquired Natalie, as she tossed
back her long braids. “I was going to offer him
some olives, but he didn’t stay for dessert. Come
on, girls. Now he’s gone we can advance.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t believe I want a drink—at least not
here,” said Alice. “But we can get past the house,
and maybe there’s a spring farther on.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The dog evidently accepted the chicken sandwich
as a peace offering for he barked no more. There
was no sign of life about the house as the girls
passed it. They soon came to a roadside watering-trough,
cut out of one solid log, into which, from
a wooden spout, there flowed a stream of clear, cold
water.</p>

<p class='c009'>The drink was refreshing, and they filled some
milk bottles they had brought with them for this
purpose, since at Bear Pond the water was not fit
to use.</p>

<p class='c009'>Again they struck into the cool, green woods,
glad of the change from the hot highway. Birds
flitted around them in the trees, calling in sweet
notes, and now and then some startled creature of
the forest darted away from beneath their very feet.
They heard the distant call of crows, and the lowing
of cows hidden in the fastness of the wood.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We are almost there,” declared Marie consulting
her elaborate directions. “It’s about half a
mile from this spring,” and she pointed at the one
where they had halted for another drink—a spring
stone-lined, in the center of a grassy plot, and
shaded by a great, gnarled oak. A spring so clear
that the sand bottom seemed but a few inches below
the surface. Yet when they replenished their
water bottles they realized that it was nearly three
feet deep. Cold and refreshing was the water.</p>

<p class='c009'>And then, a little later, they emerged from the
forest and stood on the shore of Bear Pond. They
could look down its lonesome length and see the
rock where they had first stood. The place did not
seem to have changed.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s as dreary and Dead Sea-like as before,”
said Natalie in a whisper. Somehow it seemed
natural to whisper at Bear Pond.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, now to see if we can locate the Gypsy
camp,” suggested Mrs. Bonnell. “It is early yet.
We don’t want lunch for an hour. Let’s explore
a bit first.”</p>

<p class='c009'>They walked on, keeping as near to the shore of
the lake as possible. Suddenly Natalie, who was
in the lead, held up a hand for silence.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Hark!” she called in a whisper.</p>

<p class='c009'>From somewhere in the woods ahead of them
came the sounds of barking.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Dogs,” said Marie.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And Gypsies always have lots of dogs,” added
Mabel.</p>

<p class='c009'>They pushed on. The barking became plainer.
They saw a gleam of white amid the trees.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The Gypsy camp!” exclaimed Natalie.
“We’ve found it!”</p>

    <div>THE MISSING GIRL</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>They hesitated for a moment in the shrubbery,
before going forward. They had come upon the
camp before they had quite expected to, and, truth
to tell, they had formed no definite plan of action.
Their chief desire had been to find the place where
the wanderers had set up their tents and gaudy
wagons, and, now that it lay almost at their feet,
they were unprepared.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What are we going to do?” asked Mabel.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Let’s go up, and pretend we want our fortunes
told,” suggested Alice. “Then we can look about,
and see if there is a girl there, like the one who was
at Mabel’s house.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And if there is?” asked Natalie. “If Hadee
is there?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then we can go back and tell the constable,”
put in Marie. “It does seem a shame to have her—or
any one arrested, but then they mustn’t go about
taking pocket-books—and—rings!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Suppose it isn’t the same one?” suggested
Mabel.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, that’s what we have to learn,” answered
Alice. “I say let’s walk right in, as though we had
come here by accident and wanted to have our
palms read.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I never can act that way,” declared Natalie.
“I’ll be sure to laugh—or something.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And then there are—the dogs!” faltered
Marie. “They may bite us.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“They’re barking loudly enough, anyhow,” declared
Mrs. Bonnell. “Perhaps if we each carry
part of a sandwich they’ll accept that as a peace
offering and let us alone.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I have it!” exclaimed Natalie. “We’ll have
our dinner here in the woods, first. Then maybe
we’ll think of a different plan. Anyhow, if we go
in and have our fortunes told now, it will be so late
that we’ll be starved before we can eat. Besides it
looks as though they were cooking their dinner.”</p>

<p class='c009'>She pointed toward the camp, over which a little
haze of smoke hung.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I believe Natalie is right,” declared Mrs. Bonnell.
“It will be better to eat now. We can go
back a way in the woods and have our lunch. They
haven’t discovered us. The wind is blowing away
from the camp, and the dogs haven’t detected us.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s just like some of Jack’s books!” exclaimed
Marie. “The enemy hasn’t winded us yet.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, there’s no reason why Camp Fire Girls
can’t have as many adventures as boys have,” insisted
Alice.</p>

<p class='c009'>Screened by the bushes they peered down on the
Gypsy camp that lay a little below them in a small,
grassy glade. It looked picturesque enough in the
sunlight, and, as Mrs. Bonnell had said, their presence
was not yet discovered. The dogs appeared
to be at the far side of the camp, barking among
themselves or perhaps at some wild animal they had
treed. Until the beasts scented them they were not
likely to come that way.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And, anyhow,” observed Mabel, “there must
be lots of people who go to the camp to have their
fortunes told. The dogs must be used to them. I
don’t believe they’ll harm us.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“After all, though, it will be safer to save a part
of a sandwich each, for the dogs,” insisted Mrs.
Bonnell. “That will take their attention if they
come out at us by mistake.”</p>

<p class='c009'>They laughed at her, but decided to do as she had
suggested. Then they cautiously made their way
back into a thicker part of the forest, and, sitting
about a little spring, that bubbled from the side of a
hill, they ate part of their lunch, saving some for
late afternoon, in case they lost their way again,
which did not seem likely, however.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then came a little period of rest, and Marie
proposed:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Let’s go down now, and have it over with.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You’d think she was going to the dentist,” suggested
Alice.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, my dear! Don’t mention dentist to me!”
cried Mrs. Bonnell. “I have one that needs filling,
and I’ve been putting it off as long as possible.
But I really must go—some day.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Again they approached the camp. This time they
did not halt, but went boldly on, seeing a path that
led into the midst of the circle of wagons and tents.</p>

<p class='c009'>The wind must have changed, or else the noses
of the dogs had become keener, for there arose a
canine chorus of howls and barks of protest as the
party of Camp Fire Girls came into view.</p>

<p class='c009'>A black-haired and copper-visaged man, sprawling
under a tree, sat up suddenly at the sound made
by the brutes, and, quickly surveying the approaching
party he called out in harsh tones:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Quiet there, or I’ll stone you out of camp!
Lie down!”</p>

<p class='c009'>With muttered growls the dogs obeyed, slinking
off to shady spots where flies would not so much
trouble them.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Shall we go on?” whispered Natalie, as they
came to a halt.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Of course,” declared Mrs. Bonnell. “That’s
what we are here for. Keep your eyes open now,
girls.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Again they went on. The man under the tree had
again stretched out on the grass, his slouch hat over
his eyes. Several other men peered out from the interior
of the wagons, or looked from between the
flaps of tents. Some few, surrounding a squad of
horses, did not even turn to look at the girls.</p>

<p class='c009'>A woman with a dark, wrinkled face, and straggly
gray hair, dressed in a red and yellow spotted
dress, yet, withal clean as to person and raiment,
came from a tent near the edge of the encampment—the
tent nearest the path where the girls
were walking.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Tell your fortunes, ladies,” she began with a
smirk. “Anything you want to know—with cards,
tea leaves, by the palm, or by the eyes. We use all
ways. Tell your fortunes. Queen Neezar never
fails—past, present and future!”</p>

<p class='c009'>She rattled it off—a string of patter and jargon
doubtless learned by heart. Yet she spoke English
very well, not so much grammatically, as without a
trace of accent.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Perhaps we may have our fortunes told,” said
Mrs. Bonnell. “Does more than one person tell the
fortunes? There are five of us, and——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I see—you are in a hurry. Oh, yes, all Gypsy
women can tell fortunes. We are the only ones
who can. We tell in many ways. A look at the
face is enough. I can see, lady, that you have much
fortune. You are a leader—you like to help others.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Say, that’s just the way Mrs. Bonnell is!” exclaimed
Alice, in a whisper. “Isn’t it uncanny!
I’m afraid to have her tell mine!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Nonsense! She just guessed at it,” declared
Natalie. “Any one would know Mrs. Bonnell was
a leader when they saw her bring us down like a
general, and then beginning the talk. It was just a
shrewd guess.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Maybe so,” agreed Alice. “I wonder if we’ll
all have our fortunes told? Or will we look for that
girl——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Hush!” exclaimed Natalie. “Mrs. Bonnell is
speaking.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“We would like to see all who tell fortunes,”
said the Guardian shrewdly, as she hoped. “We
too, in a way, can tell fortunes, and we would like
to pick out the one who will reveal the future to us.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That is but fair,” said Queen Neezar. “You
shall see all who tell fortunes in this camp. I am
the Queen of this tribe.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Are you, really?” asked Mabel.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am. We still keep up our old customs. We
are real Gypsies from Romany. I will tell them all
to come out and you may select whom you will.”</p>

<p class='c009'>She passed rapidly from tent to wagon, and soon
a number of young women, and old, down to girls
of fifteen and sixteen, appeared. Some were old
women, one a veritable hag, but most of them were
middle-aged, their faces dark and wrinkled, yet
with the healthy color of out-of-doors, and their
skin was beautifully clear. They seemed quite
clean, too, and the glimpses the girls had into the
tents and wagons showed them much neater than
one would have imagined on hearing the word
Gypsies.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Are—are these all fortune-tellers?” asked Mrs.
Bonnell, after a look about the camp, as her eyes
swept over the assembled group. The men did not
seem to concern themselves with what was going on,
and the dogs had quieted down.</p>

<p class='c009'>“All—yes, lady.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And have you no more—no young girls?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, lady.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“We saw one girl—once—named Hadee—is she
not with your tribe?”</p>

<p class='c009'>For an instant the Guardian was sure there passed
a look between the two older Gypsy women, and
then the Queen answered:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Hadee is no longer here.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Where is she?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“We do not know, lady. Will you have your
fortunes told?” and the voice was somewhat cold.
Mrs. Bonnell changed her tactics at once.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We will have our fortunes told,” she said decidedly.
“A different teller for each one, and it
will not take so long.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“So, Hadee is missing,” whispered Natalie, as
they followed the Queen toward the collection of
tents. “I wonder where she can be?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Maybe she has been arrested,” suggested Mabel,
in a whisper.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We would have heard about it,” declared Alice.
“More likely she has run off or been spirited
away so she won’t be caught. Oh, dear! We seem
doomed to failure!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Hush!” exclaimed Marie. “We mustn’t let
them know we suspect anything.”</p>

    <div>OLD HANSON MOVES</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Mrs. Bonnell was sure something was wrong in
the Gypsy camp. So were the girls. So much so
that none of them listened with much attention to
the jargon poured fourth by the various fortune
tellers.</p>

<p class='c009'>There was the usual talk about how each one had
had trouble—which was true enough—and that
each one was to have more which, perhaps, in the
nature of events, was still more true. But “all
would come out well in the end;” and then, too, was
talk of dark-haired strangers—and light-haired
ones—of the male variety—who would play more
or less havoc with hearts and minds.</p>

<p class='c009'>But through it all the girls felt sure there was an
undercurrent of worriment in the camp. At times
some of the men would get up and move off, accompanied
by a dog or two.</p>

<p class='c009'>Some took horses with them, sitting lazily on the
bare backs of the nags, cross-fashion, too slovenly,
it seemed to ride astraddle, or even to throw on a
sack for a saddle. Whether they rode out to do
some trading, or on another errand was not disclosed.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then, too, when Mrs. Bonnell had finished with
her fortune, in which, truth to tell, she was not
much interested, a young man, handsome enough in
his Gypsy fashion, hurried into the camp. He
strode into the tent of Neezar, the Queen, before
Mrs. Bonnell had fished the change out of her net
purse, and began an excited utterance in some unknown
tongue—probably the Gypsy argot—which
sounded like Bohemian.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Cha!” was the only word the old Gypsy uttered,
but it was enough and sent the abashed young man
out of the tent in a hurry, his flow of talk ceasing.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Their everlasting quarrels—what have I to do
with them? They are ever at me to settle their
disputes!” exclaimed Neezar. “I will have none
of it,” and she looked at Mrs. Bonnell shrewdly.
“It was about a horse,” she needlessly explained.
“The young men are much trouble.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And you rule over them also,” asked the
Guardian.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, over all.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And did Hadee dispute your authority?”</p>

<p class='c009'>It was a shrewd guess Mrs. Bonnell thought, for
the aged Gypsy looked at her suspiciously.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What do you know of Hadee?” came the quick
question.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Very little. She told the fortune of a friend of
mine, and I thought I should like to have her tell
my own.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Perhaps she will—when she comes back,” replied
the Queen, and Mrs. Bonnell thought there
was a twinkle in the deep-set eyes. “Hadee told
fortunes very well.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Would hers be any different from the one you
have told me?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“How could it—your fortune is your fortune—always
the same. No one can change it, though one
person might reveal more than another—perhaps
reveal more than would be good for you. You have
suffered—I can see it. You have had a loss.”</p>

<p class='c009'>That was evident, for Mrs. Bonnell, in spite of
the fact that she had laid aside black for the attire
of the Camp Fire Girls, while in the woods, still
kept her jet earrings and the simple little black pin
at her throat. It needed no prophetess to tell
that she had suffered.</p>

<p class='c009'>“When do you think Hadee will come back?”
asked the Guardian.</p>

<p class='c009'>“How can we tell? We Gypsies are not like
you white folks, lady. We do strange things. We
were born to wander and we wander. Doubtless
Hadee will come back—when she chooses.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Are her parents here?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“They are dead. Now I beg your pardon, but
I must see to my camp. There is much to do,
though we lead a simple life. Ah! the others have
had their fortunes told,” and she opened the tent for
her visitor who saw Natalie and the other girls
emerging from the other little canvas houses,
gaudily decorated, and painted with the various
names of the “Princesses” who deigned, for a
small piece of silver, to tear aside the curtain of the
future.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mrs. Bonnell saw Neezar hurry over to the young
man who had shown such excitement, and then the
Guardian went up to Natalie, about whom the other
girls clustered.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Tell us what she said, Nat,” urged Mabel.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It wasn’t anything—really.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Did she tell you how soon you were going to
get married?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I never am!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh!” came in a chorus of protest, and Natalie
blushed.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then they told each other snatches of what had
been revealed to them. They all agreed it was not
at all like the fortunes Hadee had told them the
time the diamond ring was missed. Then, as they
walked through the camp, on the way to where they
had left their lunch-baskets, they became aware that
the excitement was increasing, though the Gypsies
did their best to make it seem of little moment.</p>

<p class='c009'>Several men leaped on horses and rode off down
the road, and one of the young “Princesses”
started off on foot at a rapid pace in the opposite
direction.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What could have happened?” asked Marie.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Maybe they’ve got word that they are going to
be arrested,” suggested Mabel.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, I think it can’t be that,” said Mrs. Bonnell.</p>

<p class='c009'>“They’d all be leaving if they were going to be
raided,” said Natalie.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, we’ll tell that constable, who nearly arrested
you, Nat, where to find the camp,” suggested
Alice. “He may be able to get back Mrs. Anderson’s
ring.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, I hope so!” exclaimed Mabel, “but I’m not
very sanguine.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Won’t the boys be surprised when we tell them
that we located the Gypsies?” asked Marie.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And vexed, too,” added Alice. “They were so
sure they would find the camp themselves.”</p>

<p class='c009'>They passed from the bounds of the encampment,
and were soon on their way to where they had
left their boats, stopping when they reached the deep
spring to partake of the rest of their lunch, for it
was certain, now, that they would not get lost, and
the shadows had not much lengthened.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We’ll get back to camp long before supper,”
said Mabel.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I wonder what could be going on back there?”
mused Marie.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And what has happened to poor Hadee?” spoke
Natalie. “She was a pretty little thing. I hope
she isn’t in trouble.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“She looked able to take care of herself,” said
Alice.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, certainly there is something wrong,” declared
Mrs. Bonnell. “That one who called herself
a queen was really anxious to get rid of me, and
Gypsies seldom do that if you have money.”</p>

<p class='c009'>They discussed the matter from various standpoints,
but could come to no decision. They rowed
back leisurely, well satisfied, in a measure, with their
day’s outing.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Let’s stop off and see how Old Hanson is getting
on at the mysterious mill,” suggested Natalie.
“Poor old man—to think he took me for some one
he knew.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Natalie is keeping quite in the lime-light since
we came to camp,” laughed Marie. “Well, let’s go,
it’s early yet.”</p>

<p class='c009'>They turned their boats toward the shore of the
lake where the old mill was, and, in due time, were
walking toward the ancient structure.</p>

<p class='c009'>As they neared it they heard a confusion of
voices, and the rattle of goods being loaded into a
wagon. Also admonitions to horses to “stand still,
can’t yer?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What can be going on?” asked Mabel.</p>

<p class='c009'>They soon saw. In front of the mill was a farm
wagon, and old Hanson and another man were
carrying the hermit’s goods from the shack, and
putting them in the vehicle.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why, Mr. Rossmore!” exclaimed Mrs. Bonnell,
as she and the girls came up, “are you moving?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, ma’am, and I can’t git away any too soon.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Where are you going?” asked Mabel.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Over on Mr. Applebaum’s farm. It was his
wife that the Gypsies robbed of a pocket-book,” he
added. “I’m going to live with him. He’s a sort
of second cousin of mine.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then you’re going to desert the dear old mill.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, ma’am. I wouldn’t stay here another
night—not if you was to give me fifty dollars—yes
or seventy-five dollars. No, sir!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why, what is the trouble?” asked Natalie, yet
by instinct she seemed to anticipate the answer.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The hant; that’s what the matter. It’s gittin’
wuss. I wouldn’t stay here another night. I’m
done!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The hant,” repeated Marie, not quite understanding.</p>

<p class='c009'>“He means the haunt,” exclaimed Mabel in a
whisper.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, ma’am—the ghost,” went on Old Hanson.
“Th’ hant. It’s drove me out, and I never thought
it would. I thought I could stand most anything,
but it’s got terrible bad lately.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“How—what does er—it—do?” faltered Mrs.
Bonnell. Somehow, it seemed rather uncanny to
talk about the matter.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, it goes on something terrible!” exclaimed
the old hermit. “Groans and cryin’ in the middle
of the night, an’ movin’ about—takin’ things——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Taking things?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yep—lots of my things has disappeared—my
blankets and some of my grub—I ain’t goin’ t’ stand
it; I’m movin’!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Does—it—really groan?” asked Mabel, and she
could not repress a shiver.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, ma’am, it do. An’ cries, too. I heard it
all last night, an’ I couldn’t sleep. And when I go
in the old mill day-times, something like a cold wind
brushes past me.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Maybe it <i>is</i> a cold wind,” suggested Alice.
“I’m sure the old place must be draughty enough.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It wa’n’t no wind,” affirmed the old man, as he
piled a chair on top of his scanty belongings in the
wagon. The other—evidently a hired man—did not
talk, except to the horses.</p>

<p class='c009'>“So I’m goin’ t’ pull out,” went on Old Hanson.
“Th’ mill’s mine—sech as ’tis—but the hant can
have it if it wants it. I’ve got no use fer it. I want
t’ sleep in peace nights. Sech groans—sech cries—you
never heard th’ like.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Something like a cold chill seemed to pass over
the girls as they looked up at the old mill. And
then Natalie set their nerves more in a flutter by
suddenly exclaiming:</p>

<p class='c009'>“There! Look there! At the upper window.
I’m sure I saw a face!”</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>The girls clung to one another, after their first
few frightened screams of dismay, and then Mrs.
Bonnell exclaimed:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, Natalie! How could you? To frighten us
so!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I didn’t mean to. But really I did see something
at the window.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Probably a rag fluttering in the wind,” spoke
Alice.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Maybe,” assented Natalie, with a nervous
glance at the broken casement. “And yet do fluttering
rags have dark eyes, that look hopelessly at
you?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Did you see that?” demanded Mabel.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I—I think I did.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I guess Nat’s been reading too many novels,”
was Marie’s opinion.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I have not! There isn’t a thing up here to read
anyhow, if I wanted to. I was thinking of sending
for a few. But I <i>did</i> see a face at that window,”
and Natalie shook her pretty head vigorously to
emphasize her words. “It was just as you spoke,”
she went on, addressing Old Hanson.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I wouldn’t be at all s’prised,” he admitted.
“I’m sure there’s a hant here, and that’s why I’m
movin’. I wouldn’t stay here another night.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Tell us more about it,” urged Mrs. Bonnell.
“Maybe it can all be explained by natural causes.
I never heard of a ghost yet, that couldn’t.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“This ’un can’t!” declared the old hermit.
“Sech groans an’ cries, an’ goin’s on! An’ cold
winds sweeping over you ’fore you know what’s
up.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Maybe you left a door open?” suggested Marie.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No’m, I never do that. It’s the ghost—that’s
what ’tis. Th’ mill is haunted. I’ve allers heard
’twas, but I never believed it until lately. Now, I’m
goin’ to quit!”</p>

<p class='c009'>The girls and the Guardian gathered closer together
and watched the preparations to move on the
part of Old Hanson. He had most of his household
goods out of the shack next to the mill now.
As he went back for something one of the horses
started slightly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“There it is! There it is!” suddenly cried the
old hermit from within the shack. “It jest brushed
past me! I felt a cold hand on the back of my
neck! Oh, I’m a goner! I’m doomed. It’s the call
of fate!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Whoa there!” called the farm hand to the restless
steeds, that had jumped nervously at the sound
of the old man’s weird scream.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Come on!” cried Natalie. “I’ve had enough
of this. I won’t sleep a wink to-night. Come on,
girls!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, it’s—getting late,” added Marie. “We
must get back to camp.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Not to mention staying here after dark,” added
Mabel. “Oh! Perhaps it’s silly, but I don’t like
it. Are you sure you saw something, Nat?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Of course I did. I don’t know what it was, but
it looked like a face— Oh, don’t let’s talk about
it,” she begged.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mr. Rossmore had rushed from the shack with
the last few of his household goods. He threw
them into the wagon.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Go on!” he cried to the farm hand. “Drive
away from here as fast as you can. I don’t ever
want to see the place again. It near had me that
time.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What was it?” demanded Mrs. Bonnell.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The hant, sure. Oh, what a place!” and leaping
up on the wagon seat he called to the horses
which seemed glad enough to leave the eerie place.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Come on, girls!” cried Natalie, as the wagon
rattled off down the road. “We must get back to
camp.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Before dark,” added Mabel.</p>

<p class='c009'>“My! but we’ve had a full day!” declared Alice.
“But we found the Gypsy camp.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And a lot of good it did us,” said Marie. “We
didn’t locate the girl we wanted.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, the police can do that,” said Mrs. Bonnell.
“We’ll tell them where the camp is, and the constables
can look after the suspects.”</p>

<p class='c009'>With a last glance at the old mill, which seemed
silent and deserted enough now, and a parting look
at the disappearing wagon, the Camp Fire Girls
made their way to where they had left their boats.
Soon they were rowing over the peaceful lake,
which the setting sun was painting in hues of vermillion,
olive and yellow.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Isn’t it beautiful,” said Natalie softly, as she
hummed a few strains of “The Land of the Sky-blue
Water.” “Beautiful!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And to think of the old mill and—” began
Marie.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don’t,” suggested Alice. “Let’s enjoy the sunset.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Silently they rowed onward, their faces to the
glorious colors in the west.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Wo-he-lo! Wo-he-lo!” suddenly called Marie,
as they neared the shore. “Wo-he-lo!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What is it? Who is it?” asked Mabel.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The boys. There they are on shore, waiting
for us,” and she waved her hand.</p>

<p class='c009'>Over the water came floating the echo of the call
of the Camp Fire Girls:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Wo-he-lo!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Work—health—love!” murmured Natalie.
“What a wonderful combination for—girls.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And the greatest of these is—love,” softly
quoted Alice.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m thinking of that poor Gypsy girl,” murmured
Natalie. “She perhaps had plenty of
work—but I wonder how much of—love? Did
she have any?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“She had health, at any rate,” observed Mabel,
as she pulled on her left oar to change the course
of the craft.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Of course—if she was anything like the other
girls in the camp,” admitted Natalie. “But perhaps
she has been driven away—maybe the rest of
the tribe found she had been—been taking things,
and drove her away. She may have taken her
health with her, but very little of love, I’m afraid.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, no doubt some of those Gypsy lads, with
their beautifully white teeth, are in love with her,”
suggested Mabel.</p>

<p class='c009'>“That isn’t the only kind of love there is,” said
Natalie softly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, my! How romantic we’re getting!” cried
Alice. “I declare, that haunted mill must have affected
all of us.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Let’s forget it,” suggested Mrs. Bonnell. “I
wonder what the boys want? They seem a bit
excited.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The three chums were hurrying down to the
water’s edge and, as the boats approached, Blake
hailed the girls.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Where have you been?” he demanded.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Out for a row,” evaded Marie.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Were you over to our camp?” asked Jack.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Your camp? No,” answered his sister. “What
do you mean?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why some one has been there and about cleaned
us out of grub. We thought maybe you girls had
borrowed some.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Indeed not,” answered Marie. “We are just
getting back. We’ve been to Bear Pond again.
But, girls!” she exclaimed, “if the boys have had
unseen visitors, perhaps we have too. Let’s look,”
and, springing from the boat she hurried up to the
tents.</p>

    <div>MYSTIFICATION</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>“Anything missing?” gasped Mrs. Bonnell, as
she came up the slope from the lake, whither Natalie
had sped in advance.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don’t you dare tell us there is!” cried Marie.</p>

<p class='c009'>“There doesn’t seem to be,” went on the Guardian,
whose rather short breath bore to her the unwelcome
intelligence that she was getting stout.
“I really must exercise more,” she told herself.
“I am positively getting indolent, and in camp—of
all things!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Everything seems to be as we left it,” declared
Natalie after a hurried glance around, while Mrs.
Bonnell sat down on a board nailed between two
trees making a rustic seat.</p>

<p class='c009'>“They could easily have opened our tent, gone in
and tied the flaps back again,” suggested Alice.
“Do hurry and look in, Nat!” for breath-of-the-pine-tree
was fumbling with the knots of the cords.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We must learn to tie some of the queer knots
the boy scouts have in their manual book,” suggested
Mabel.</p>

<p class='c009'>By this time Natalie had succeeded in loosening
the tent-flaps. With the boys gathered in a circle
back of them the girls peered into their sleeping and
living quarters.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Everything seems all right,” murmured Natalie.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Unlock the trunks and make sure,” suggested
Alice. “If they have taken my best dress I——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You won’t go over to the dance at the Point to-morrow
night; will you?” asked Jack.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Indeed, I’ll not. But don’t suggest such a
thing!”</p>

<p class='c009'>The girls crowded into the tent, and a hurried
search disclosed that, so far as they could tell, nothing
was missing.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Though they may have taken all our things to
eat,” said Marie. “If they have, we’ll have to depend
on you boys.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Huh! We’re cleaned out,” exclaimed Phil.
“We came to get enough of your stuff for supper.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You poor boys!” murmured Mabel.</p>

<p class='c009'>“This is the first they’ve thought of us,” declared
Blake. “They’re so anxious about their own stuff
that they didn’t care what had happened to ours.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, we did so!” declared Alice. “Only you
frightened us, meeting us the way you did.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Tell us all about it,” urged Natalie.</p>

<p class='c009'>“There isn’t anything to tell,” replied Jack.
“We had been off fishing, and when we came back
we found our pantry pretty well cleaned out. Lucky
we didn’t have an awful lot. We had to stock up
again to-morrow, anyhow.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Let’s go over and take a look, girls,” proposed
Marie. “We won’t need to get much for supper.
There are some cold beans and——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What about us?” came from Jack. “Don’t
you s’pose we want to eat?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, you can come to supper with us,” suggested
Mrs. Bonnell. “After that we’ll all go over
to the Point in the motor-boat—that is if it runs—and
we’ll stock up.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Good!” cried Blake. “And we’ll have a dance
after it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then come on!” proposed Alice. “We’ll look
for clues, and decide who it is took their things.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ha! Ha! That’s a good one!” jeered Jack.
“Look for clues! Why you couldn’t even find your
way home from Bear Pond!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But we did to-day,” said his sister quietly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You did? Were you over there again?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“We were,” replied Marie.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You must be fond of the place,” suggested
Jack. “What did you find this time—a snake?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“We located the Gypsy Camp,” said Natalie
gently.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You did?” chorused the boys, all excitement.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We did,” went on Natalie. “And we’re going
to tell the constable about it, and see if he can get
back Mabel’s mother’s ring—it was the same band
of Gypsies we think.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The same band!” cried Jack.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes,” continued Mabel. “There was a Hadee
in it, only she was missing. And we had our fortunes
told, and there seemed to be some excitement
in the camp, and——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don’t tell it all!” exclaimed Mabel. “Leave
some for the rest of us. Old Hanson is moving,
boys because——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“He saw a ghost!” broke in Alice.</p>

<p class='c009'>“He heard it, you mean,” corrected Marie.
“Nat was the only one who saw it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m not so sure,” said Natalie, doubtfully.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Say, kindly translate,” begged Blake in a weak
voice as he pretended to support himself against
Jack. “What does all this mean, anyhow?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s got me going,” admitted Phil.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Let me sit down—then please tell it all over
again,” pleaded Jack. “Now proceed,” and he took
a seat beside Mrs. Bonnell.</p>

<p class='c009'>Gradually the girls gave a connected story of their
trip that afternoon, including their meeting with
the man of the old mill.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And to cap the climax,” finished Natalie, “you
boys meet us and say your camp has been looted—is
that the proper word?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“We’ll permit you to use it semi-occasionally,”
said Blake, “though I think it is taboo in Camp
Fire Girls’ rules.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, anyhow, let’s go over and see what we can
find in the boys’ camp,” suggested Marie.</p>

<p class='c009'>“After what you have gone through with to-day
you can accomplish anything,” declared Blake.
“To think of you finding the Gypsy camp at Bear
Pond, when, all the while, we had a notion that it
was at Mt. Harry.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And we’ve been trying to locate it there,” added
Phil.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We know it,” laughed Marie. “That’s why
we didn’t tell you where we were going. We wanted
to surprise you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And you succeeded beautifully,” put in her
brother. “Come on over to our desolate abode.
Maybe you can look at the place where the dog
biscuits were kept and tell what kind of an ostrich
ate them.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I have it!” suddenly cried Natalie, while they
all prepared to walk to the other camp.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What—the dog biscuits?” demanded Jack.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, but I know who has been at your camp.
It’s some of the Gypsies—that’s why they were so
excited to-day when we had our fortunes told.
They knew we girls were friends of yours, and
they thought we had come to spy on them.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, we hope you <i>are</i> friends of ours,” spoke
Jack, “but as for the Gypsies suspecting that you
had come to spy on them, because our camp had
been looted, as Nat puts it, why it couldn’t be.
They must have known you made an early start, and
they didn’t come to our camp—if it was they who
did it—until after you had left here. No, you’ve
got to think up a better reason than that.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, I’m sure the Gypsies were at your camp,”
insisted Mabel.</p>

<p class='c009'>“A woman’s reason—because,” laughed Jack.</p>

<p class='c009'>They were soon at the boys’ camp, and in the
gathering dusk the girls were shown where a box
containing the provisions had been broken open,
and a considerable quantity of supplies taken.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Did they only take victuals?” asked Mrs. Bonnell.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I guess so,” answered Phil. “We didn’t look
after we found that our grub—I beg your pardon,
ladies, I should say our choice viands—were taken,”
and he bowed low.</p>

<p class='c009'>Blake who had gone into the sleeping tent came
out with a woeful face.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s gone!” he cried. “It’s gone!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What?” demanded Natalie.</p>

<p class='c009'>“My best silk handkerchief!” cried Blake. “I
paid two dollars for it—all the colors of the rainbow,
too! Oh, woe is me!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, if I’m glad of one thing, I’m glad that’s
missing!” fairly yelled Jack. “Of all the gaudy
Italian opera effects that was the limit! You could
hear it halfway across the lake. I couldn’t sleep
with it in the same tent. Now, we’ll have some
peace!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Is it really gone, Blake?” asked Alice.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It sure is.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And I was hoping I’d fall heir to that to make
a sash of,” his sister went on. “But it proves one
thing.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, yes!” Blake exclaimed sarcastically. “As
long as we get some proof out of it, no matter
whether or not our whole camp is looted—notice
that word looted. Well, sis, what is it that’s
proved?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The Gypsies were here.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Huh! We knew that before.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But this makes it certain. Gypsies, as you
know, are very fond of bright-colored articles—especially
to wear. They could not resist your handkerchief.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Encyclopædia Britannica—volume Gyp to
Jap!” exclaimed Blake. “With marginal notes on
colored handkerchiefs and silk weaving in particular.
Sis, you’re a wonder! Fellows; bustle around
and see what you’ve missed. Maybe she can build
up a theory to prove that a fish climbed out of the
water and took my handkerchief to make a hammock
for the little ones. Is it not mar-vee-li-ous!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Horrid thing!” pouted Alice. “I was trying
to help you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I think she’s right,” announced Natalie, and, as
she was no one’s sister, the boys at once changed
their viewpoint.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, there may be something in it,” admitted
Blake. “Gypsies sure do like bright-colored things.
But why did they stop at my handkerchief? Why
didn’t they take some of those rainbow neckties
that Phil insists on tearing the atmosphere with; or
some of Jack’s——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That’ll do old man!” came from the latter
quickly. “There are some objects too sacred to
mention. Let us have peace.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I say let’s have supper,” broke in Marie.
“We’re nearly starved. If you boys are coming
over with us, come on. We can theorize later.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Good idea,” declared Phil. “Lead on—we’ll all
follow.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Perhaps the ladies have a few more deductions
to make,” suggested Jack, politely.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I think we have discovered enough for one
day,” spoke Natalie. “We have been doing all the
discovering. Why don’t you boys do some?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The action has been entirely too rapid for us,”
confessed Blake. “We are willing to let you have
a try at the mystificating problem. All we know
is that we are hungry, and we have not the wherewithal
to eat.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then come on over to our camp,” proposed the
Guardian. “Girls—show that you are real members
of the Camp Fire tribe. We must feed these
hungry warriors.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Where are their fish?” asked Alice.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We didn’t get any,” confessed her brother.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Feed us this time, and we’ll get up a party for
you next week.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Wait until I see if we’ve got gasoline enough to
run the motor-boat over to the Point and back,”
suggested Jack, as he hurried down to the little dock.
“Then we’ll dine with you, fair ladies.”</p>

<p class='c009'>He was seen to come to a halt near the edge of the
water.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What’s the matter?” called Blake.</p>

<p class='c009'>“More mysteries,” answered Jack. “Our little
canoe is gone!”</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Camp Fire Girls and camping boys gathered in
a little group on the edge of the lake, standing about
Jack, who was mutely pointing to a stake in the
water.</p>

<p class='c009'>“There’s where she was tied,” he said. “And
now she’s gone!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Maybe she floated away,” suggested Blake.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Not much!” cried Jack. “I haven’t learned to
tie all sorts of sailor knots now to slip up and make
a grannie-hitch at this day. That canoe couldn’t
come untied unless some one did it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And it’s out of sight now,” remarked Phil, as he
swept his eyes over the surface of the lake.
“Hadn’t we better get after it in the motor-boat?
Have we any gas?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I forgot to look. When I saw the canoe gone
I got all worked up.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Did it belong to you boys?” asked Natalie.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, and that’s the worst of it. We hired it
over at Glen’s dock,” said Jack, “and he’s sure to
charge us double what it was worth if we don’t return
it at the end of the season.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“When did you notice it was gone?” asked Mrs.
Bonnell.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Just now. Of course it was gone when we came
back here from our trip, but we didn’t notice it, I
guess. But it’s sure gone all right,” and Jack added
his searching gaze to that of his two chums. But
on the darkening surface of the lake there was no
such craft to be seen as the small green canoe the
boys had hired.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Let’s get right out in the motor,” proposed
Jack, who had taken the screw-plug from the gasoline
tank in the bow, and ascertained, by dipping in
a stick, that there was fuel enough to run to the
Point and back.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Better wait until after supper,” advised Marie.
“Come over to our camp, boys, and we’ll give you
the best meal we can get up in a hurry. Then we’ll
go over to the Point with you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But we want to look for our canoe,” insisted
Phil.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I know,” replied his sister, “but we’ve got to
go to the Point anyhow. You need some supplies,
and the canoe is just as likely to be in that direction
as any other.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Not much!” insisted Jack. “The Gypsies
wouldn’t take it over that way—too many chances
of being seen.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What makes you think the Gypsies took it?”
asked Mabel.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Of course they took it!” cried Jack. “Who
else? We come back to find our camp looted, to
quote Natalie, and——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, Jack! You’re making fun of me?” she exclaimed.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am not, Nat! Looted is a dandy word. Anyhow,
our camp is cleaned out, Blake’s best handkerchief
is gone, and good riddance to that Italian
opera, I claim——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You wait!” threatened the loser. “I’ll get
even with you all right!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And then our canoe is gone,” went on Jack,
ignoring the protest. “The Gypsies must have been
going about the lake in some kind of boat. They
saw our camp deserted, and helped themselves.
Then they towed off our canoe.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But how do you account for them not taking
anything from our camp?” asked Mabel.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, they were too polite,” said Blake. “Besides,
they may not have had time. Well, if we’re
going to get a move on, let’s do it!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Come over in about fifteen minutes,” suggested
Mrs. Bonnell. “We’ll be ready for you then.
Come on, girls,” and she led the way back to Dogwood
camp, leaving the boys to discuss among
themselves the queer happenings, while the girls
were no less exercised over what had occurred.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, dear!” exclaimed Natalie. “I don’t like
these Gypsies so near at hand. It makes me nervous.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“They’re not near,” said Mabel. “Why, are
you afraid of being kidnapped?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Hardly,” replied Natalie. “But who knows?
They may take all our clothes some day when we’re
not at camp, and we’d have to go home in these
suits.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“If they all became us as well as yours does you,
Nat,” said the Guardian, “I’m sure we wouldn’t
object. I’m sure mine makes me look ever so much
stouter. I really must exercise more and eat less.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“If the Gypsies make off with our larder we’ll
all of us eat less,” suggested Alice with a laugh.
“Well, we must see what we can give the boys. I
know they must be nearly famished.”</p>

<p class='c009'>And from the manner in which the campers of
Stony Point did justice to the hasty meal that the
Camp Fire Girls prepared, it was evident that
Alice’s conjecture was right.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And now for the Point!” cried Blake. “Shall
we help you lock up, girls?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Such locking as we can do,” spoke Marie. “I
wish there was some way of making a tent more secure.
The next time we go camping we must have
a log cabin. We can lock that.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Leave a lantern burning,” suggested Phil.
“That will make any unwelcome visitors think some
one is at home. That’s what we always do.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The girls agreed that this might be a good plan,
and a light was left within the tent, securely fastened
against the possibility of an upset, should a squirrel
or other prowler enter in search of food. Another
lantern was lighted and hung outside, and the boys,
having done likewise at their camp, the motor-boat
was gotten in readiness for the trip to the Point
after supplies.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And we’ll keep a lookout for our canoe on the
way,” suggested Phil.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Not much chance of spotting it after dark,” replied
Blake.</p>

<p class='c009'>“But if we see a rowboat, or one canoe towing
another we’ll sort of sneak up and take a look,” remarked
Jack.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, boys!” cried Natalie, “please don’t have
any—unpleasantness.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Unpleasantness is—good!” affirmed Phil.
“We’ll just throw them overboard, Nat, if we find
any of them have our canoe, and then all the unpleasantness
will be on their side.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, boys! You couldn’t!” and she seemed
really alarmed.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Of course they won’t,” said Alice witheringly.
“Don’t let them scare you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, we’re going to get our canoe,” declared
Phil doggedly.</p>

<p class='c009'>But though the boys kept a sharp lookout on their
way to the Point they saw no signs of their missing
craft. Once at the Point, which was a sort of
gathering place for the campers and cottagers from
all the coves and inlets of the lake, the boys gave
their orders for groceries, and then danced with the
girls, for the nightly hops were a feature there.</p>

<p class='c009'>“‘A good time was had by all,’ as the Weekly
Clarion of Hensfoot Corners will say next week,”
remarked Blake, as the little party prepared to go
back to camp.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It <i>was</i> enjoyable,” declared Natalie who was
very fond of dancing. “I hated to come away.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’ll go back with you,” offered Blake. “We
can get a boat to bring us over.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You’ll do nothing of the kind!” exclaimed Mrs.
Bonnell, with a laugh. “It’s time my Camp Fire
Girls were home and in bed.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, very well, Nat,” sighed Blake. “Some
other time.”</p>

<p class='c009'>They found their camps undisturbed, the lighted
lanterns seemingly serving them well in their absence.
But, as on the going trip, there was no sign
of the missing canoe. Nor did a casual search the
boys made the next day bring it to light.</p>

<p class='c009'>They reported their loss to the local authorities,
and one of the constables said he would do what he
could to find the craft.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Though it isn’t very hopeful,” he told them.
“It’s so easy to paint a canoe over, and they all look
alike.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The officer seemed more interested in hearing
about the location of the Gypsy wagons and tents
at Bear Pond, and made a trip to the girls’ camp to
learn about them. He was given the directions to
find it, and said he would make an investigation at
once.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And, if you can,” urged Mabel, “see if you can
get back my mother’s ring.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I will,” he promised, but the girls well knew that
there was but a small chance of success.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Maybe we should have told him about the
haunted mill,” suggested Natalie.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No!” declared Mrs. Bonnell. “That was only
some foolish fancy of that hermit. The mill isn’t
haunted.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Of course not,” Natalie agreed, “but I’m sure
I saw a face at the window that day.”</p>

<p class='c009'>But nothing was said to the constable about it.</p>

<p class='c009'>Several days passed, and nothing new developed.
The boys did not find their canoe, and nothing was
heard about the visit of the constable to the Gypsy
camp.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Camp Fire Girls and their brothers and
friend, went on excursions together, and had a
general good time. The summer had been an ideal
one, so far, they all agreed. The girls did some
more clay work, and Mrs. Bonnell sent to the Camp
Fire Headquarters for a hand loom on which to
make bead work.</p>

<p class='c009'>“For you girls will soon be Fire Makers,” she
said, “and will want to wear some of the bead
head-bands. You can begin weaving your particular
designs now. Natalie can make a pine tree for her
symbol, Marie a bird, Mabel an ear of corn, and
Alice an Indian tepee.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I think Natalie will look perfectly stunning with
a bead head-band over her black hair,” whispered
Marie.</p>

<p class='c009'>“She’s stunning as she is now—a regular Pocahontas,”
answered Mabel.</p>

<p class='c009'>The girls were delighted with the bead work, and
kept at it so steadily that the boys complained they
would not “come out and play.”</p>

<p class='c009'>It was late one afternoon when Mrs. Bonnell, who
had been walking through the woods with Marie,
who wanted to look for a certain flower, came back.
She had left Natalie and Mabel together, at their
bead work.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Where’s Natalie?” asked the Guardian. “I
have a lovely idea for her bead head-band.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“She went out to meet you,” said Mabel. “Some
time ago. Didn’t you see her?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No!” exclaimed Mrs. Bonnell, as she looked at
the lengthening shadows over the lake. “I—wish—she
would come back.”</p>

<p class='c009'>In spite of themselves the girls and their Guardian
felt a chill of fear strike to their hearts.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Let’s call!” suggested Marie.</p>

<p class='c009'>They united their voices in Natalie’s name, varying
the summons with “Wo-he-lo!” and “Dogwood
camp!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What’s the matter?” asked Blake, who came
running over a little later.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Natalie is missing!” exclaimed Mabel. “Oh,
Blake, what could have happened to her?”</p>

    <div>ON THE TRAIL</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>“Now, the first thing you want to do is to keep
cool,” advised Blake. “Take it easy—nothing
could have happened to her.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, but you don’t know—there might,” gasped
Alice.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What is it?” asked Jack, as he and Phil came
up on the run, having followed Blake when they
heard the girls calling.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Natalie is missing!” exclaimed Mrs. Bonnell.
“Marie and I went for a walk in the woods, leaving
Mabel and Natalie here. When did she leave you,
Mabel?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Soon after you started out.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That’s nearly two hours ago. And she’s been
gone all this time,” commented the Guardian.
“Did she say which way she was going?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No,” answered Mabel. “I didn’t pay much attention.
I was looking after that beef stew, and I
didn’t want it to burn, so I kept going in the tent
ever so often.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I heard Natalie say, when I was over the stove
at one time, that she was going into the woods, and
I took it for granted that she would follow you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“We didn’t see anything of her,” said Marie.
“We walked slowly at first, so she could easily
have caught up to us.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And it’s getting darker,” murmured Alice, who
had been over to the boys’ camp, doing a bit of sewing
for her brother. She had followed them as they
ran to Dogwood in response to the calls.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, isn’t it too bad!” exclaimed Mrs. Bonnell.</p>

<p class='c009'>“She’ll turn up all right!” asserted Blake.
“Then you didn’t see which way she went, Mabel?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, I was in the cooking tent. But she wouldn’t
go off the main path; would she?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It doesn’t seem so,” spoke Marie. “Oh, we
must find her! She can’t stay in the woods,” and
there was a catch in her voice.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now, take it easy, sis,” advised her brother.
“We’ll find her all right. All we’ll have to do is to
begin a search. She probably went farther than
she meant to and it takes longer to come back.
Come on, boys, we’ll start on the trail.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You must have lanterns!” insisted the Guardian.
“It will soon be too dark to see. We have
a number of ’em. Girls, light ’em up!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Are we going to stay here—alone?” asked
Alice.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You always have,” said her brother.</p>

<p class='c009'>“But Natalie——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Let ’em come along, if they want to,” suggested
Jack. “It’s no fun waiting around for news. But
we’ll soon find her,” he added. “We’ll each take
a different trail—there are three main ones into the
woods—Nat must be on one of those. Each fellow
can take a girl, and Mrs. Bonnell can be a sort of
director of operations.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The girls paired off with their brothers, and soon
the woods bore the appearance of a forest wherein
flickered big fireflies, for the lanterns bobbed here
and there amid the trees, as do the insects on a
June evening.</p>

<p class='c009'>As the boys and Camp Fire Girls went slowly
along they called from time to time, their voices
echoing through the fast-darkening woods. But
there came no answering cry.</p>

<p class='c009'>The three main trails into the woods did not diverge
greatly, and it was possible for the three
searching parties to keep in communication with
one another. From time to time one or the other
called, asking for any news. But none was forthcoming.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, we <i>must</i> find her!” exclaimed Mrs. Bonnell.
“Something must have happened to her!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I think that must be it,” agreed Jack; Mrs.
Bonnell having accompanied him and his sister.
“Maybe she has fallen and——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, Jack!” begged Marie. “Don’t say such
horrid things!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why not—if they’re true? We might as well
recognize that something is likely to have happened.
We’ve got to face the music.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Poor Natalie!” breathed Marie. “Oh!” she
screamed a moment later.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What is it?” demanded Mrs. Bonnell.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Something went right over my foot.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“A snake—I mean hoptoad,” and Jack quickly
corrected himself.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don’t mention it!” cried Marie with a shudder.</p>

<p class='c009'>She clung to her brother, who flashed the lantern
back and forth. Again and again was Natalie’s
name called, but the echoes from the dark woods
were the only replies.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, what can have become of her?” whispered
Mabel to Phil. “Do you suppose——?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What’s the use of supposing anything?” he
answered a bit shortly. “We’ll know when we
find her, and not before.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Then they tramped on, and, a little later, a call
from their left gave them hope. Blake and Alice
were over there.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What is it?” called Phil. “Have you found
her?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No,” answered Blake in disappointed tones.
“Alice thought she heard her, but it turned out to
be a stray cow. Any luck?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Not a bit!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Where are the others?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Not far off. I can see their light. I guess they
haven’t struck any clues.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“We’ll have to wait until morning.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I think so, but we’ll look a little farther.”</p>

<p class='c009'>So they kept on. But it was evident that Natalie
was not in that part of the woods. After some
difficulty the three bands of searchers got together
again, Jack, his sister and Mrs. Bonnell having
wandered into a sort of swamp, where the water
oozed over their shoes. They were wet, tired and
miserable.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We—we can’t find her!” faltered Marie.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, where can she be?” murmured Mabel.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now, there’s no use worrying,” insisted Blake.</p>

<p class='c009'>“But, we can’t help it,” said his sister.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We just must, girls,” declared Mrs. Bonnell
in firm tones. “We must not worry!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But, poor Natalie!” cried Alice.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Be sensible,” ordered the Guardian. “She is
well and strong, and able to take care of herself.
Something may have unavoidably detained her,
and——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But, where did she go? Where could she stay
after dark?” Marie wanted to know.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We can’t tell. Certainly we will have to find
her. Perhaps we had better go back to camp and
summon help,” suggested Mrs. Bonnell.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, let’s!” chorused the girls, and this was
voted the best plan.</p>

<p class='c009'>“There’s a camp of young fellows not far from
ours,” said Jack when they were all back at Dogwood—a
disconsolate enough party. “We’ll get
them and beat the woods. You girls had better
stay here now. We’ll find her. I’ll row down in
one of your boats, and get them.”</p>

<p class='c009'>He hurried to the little dock, and at once called
out:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Where’s your small rowboat?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Isn’t it there?” asked Mrs. Bonnell in surprised
tones.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Not a sign of it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>In the flickering light of the lanterns those near
the tents looked at each other. Then Marie cried:</p>

<p class='c009'>“I see it now! Natalie went out in a boat and
is drowned! Oh, Natalie!” and she fell to sobbing
on Mrs. Bonnell’s shoulder.</p>

<div class='chapter'>

</div>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c007'>
    <div>A SPRAINED ANKLE</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>“Now look here, sis!” exclaimed Jack, purposely
cross. “This is all nonsense! Natalie isn’t
drowned any more than you are! Don’t be silly!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m not!” she retorted, brought somewhat to
herself by his manner of speaking. “But isn’t the
boat gone?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Of course it is,” he admitted, “and it may be
that Nat is in it. But that’s a long way from saying
she is drowned. Nat knows how to manage a
boat.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then why doesn’t she come home?” asked
Alice.</p>

<p class='c009'>“There <i>you</i> go!” cried her brother. “You
girls are all alike—bound to look on the dark side.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well,” tearfully protested Alice, “can you
show us a bright side?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Of course!” exclaimed Blake. “She may have
met some friends, and gone to supper with them.
They may have picked her up in their launch.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But Natalie wouldn’t go without sending some
word to us,” objected Mrs. Bonnell.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Maybe she did send word, and the person forgot
to bring it,” said Jack. “I’ve had that happen
to me lots of times. She’ll be found all right,
you see.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, of course I don’t believe anything serious
could happen to her,” said Mrs. Bonnell, “only—well,
it is getting late,” and she looked across the
dark lake, and a little shiver of nervous fear made
her tremble.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Besides, Natalie doesn’t know any one up here
who has a launch, and with whom she would go
to supper,” went on Mabel.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now, it’s your turn to throw cold water,” objected
her brother. “How do you know whom Nat
might have met since she’s been up here? You girls
aren’t always together, and she may have met some
young fellow, and not wanted to tell you about
him,” and he looked over at Blake, and nudged Phil.</p>

<p class='c009'>“That’s right,” chimed in the latter.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, nonsense!” exclaimed his sister. “Natalie
wouldn’t do such a thing as that. Oh, but what can
we do?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Hadn’t we better notify some one—some of
the constables—and have him get up a searching
party?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Say, those constables aren’t worth their salt,”
declared Jack. “They couldn’t find a lost cow, let
alone a pretty girl. Why, they couldn’t even find
the Gypsy camp, and that was plain enough after
you girls got on the trail. The constables are no
good!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then what can we do?” asked Mabel. “We
must do something to find her. It’s awful to stand
around this way and do nothing!” and she
stamped her foot in troubled vexation.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’ll get those young fellows at the other camp,”
said Phil. “Then we’ll start some of them out in
the boat, and the rest of us will search through the
woods again.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I guess that plan is as good as any,” agreed
Mrs. Bonnell. “Poor Natalie! I wonder what
possessed her to go off by herself?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Maybe she got some clue to the lost Gypsy
girl?” suggested Jack.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, you boys!” exclaimed the Guardian.
“You are always thinking of clues and trails! Be
reasonable.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, Nat had some good cause for going off,
I’ll say that much,” declared Phil, and Blake nodded
in assent.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Go get those other fellows,” suggested Jack.
“I’ll bail out a boat, one of ours has sprung a
leak.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why not take the launch?” asked Blake.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Something’s the matter with the carburetor
again,” replied Jack. “They might get stuck out
in the middle of the lake.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That’s a peach of a boat!” murmured Blake.
“If we come up here again next year we’ll have
our own. This one is out of order half the time.
The fellow who hired it to us ought to give us a rebate.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“If we don’t find that missing canoe of his he’ll
take so much of our money that we’ll have to walk
home,” added Phil.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, we’ll have a good search in the morning,”
said Jack. “Now then, let’s get busy after
Natalie.”</p>

<p class='c009'>While the girls stood about, well-nigh distracted,
and not knowing what to do, save to talk in shivery
whispers, and to speculate on what might have
happened to their Camp Fire chum, Phil hurried
off to where the other boys had their tent. He was
soon heard returning with them.</p>

<p class='c009'>They readily agreed to join in the search, and
some of them prepared to set off in one of the
larger rowboats, with Phil, while the others got
more lanterns and prepared for another tramp
through the woods.</p>

<p class='c009'>The boat was just about to be pushed off from
the little improvised dock, when the sound of oars
out on the lake was heard, the echo coming distinctly
over the water, and through the still darkness.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Hark!” exclaimed Mabel.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Some one is coming,” added Marie.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Maybe with—news,” faltered Alice.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then came a hail.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Wo-he-lo! Dogwood!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s Natalie!” chorused her chums, while Blake
raised his voice in a gladsome shout:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Natalie! Where have you been? Are you all
right?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“All right, yes, of course. Reuben is bringing
me home.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Reuben?” Blake questioned quickly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“That’s the milk-and-farm boy,” said Alice in a
low voice.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, yes.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Hurry, Natalie!” called Mrs. Bonnell. “What
happened to you? What kept you? Where were
you? We were just going in search of you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m all right,” answered the voice from out in
the darkness, and then the rescuers could see a faint
glimmer of light in a moving boat. “I sprained
my ankle, and I couldn’t walk. Reuben came along
and found me, and brought me home in his boat.
We’ll be there in a minute.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Busted part of the blade off one of my oars,”
explained the country lad. “That’s why it took
us so long. The boat wouldn’t go straight.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The boys and girls crowded down to the edge of
the water and waited anxiously. Now they could
discern the approaching boat more clearly. In a
little while it grated on the pebbles of the beach,
and by the light of the lanterns with which the second
searching party had been about to start out,
they could see the missing girl resting on some
blankets in the bottom of the craft.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, Natalie!” cried Mrs. Bonnell. “We’ve
been so worried about you!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I know it, dear Guardie, but I couldn’t help it.
I fell and sprained my ankle.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Where?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“In the haunted mill.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The haunted mill!” cried Alice. “Were you
there, Natalie Fuller?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I was. Oh, Blake, my dear, don’t try to lift
me out until I straighten my foot! Oh!” and she
shrank back with pain, for Blake had gotten into
the boat and was endeavoring to lift her out.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Give me a hand here, you fellows,” he ordered
somewhat roughly, but they knew how he felt.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, no, Blake, really!” begged Natalie after
a moment. “If you wait I can get up by myself,
and then, if you let me lean on your shoulder I can
manage to hobble to the tent, I think. It isn’t so
bad, really.”</p>

<p class='c009'>He watched her carefully as she got in position.
Then as she bore a slight weight on the sprained
ankle he saw her sway. The next moment he had
caught her in his arms.</p>

<p class='c009'>“She’s fainted!” he exclaimed. “I’ll carry her
up to the tent,” and he took her out on shore and
hurried toward the canvas shelter.</p>

    <div>AWAITING THE GHOST</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>“Wasn’t it silly of me to go off that way?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Do you feel all right now?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Let her smell of the ammonia again.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, thank you, Marie. It’s too strong. The
salts are better,” spoke Natalie protestingly. She
was sitting up on a cot in the tent, while the boys
clustered at the flap outside, and the girls and Mrs.
Bonnell gathered around her. The first aid work
had ended successfully when Natalie opened her
eyes after her swoon.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t understand how I fainted,” she said
feebly. “I never did such a thing before.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It was the pain,” said Mabel. “Blake carried
you in splendidly, though.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, did he <i>carry</i> me?” and a dull red suffused
the olive-like tint of Natalie’s cheeks.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Of course!” exclaimed Mrs. Bonnell. “Why
not? It was the most sensible thing to do under
the circumstances. How is the ankle?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It pains considerably.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“We must try hot and cold compresses. Marie,
put the kettle on the oil stove at once. Boys, you
clear out of here. We can look after her now—much
obliged to you though. You might bring
a couple of pails of water, if you don’t mind, before
you go.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Here’s your hat—what’s your hurry,” murmured
Phil half sarcastically.</p>

<p class='c009'>“After all we did—to be thrown out this way!”
wailed Jack.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And we haven’t heard what happened!” added
Blake. “Let Nat tell us the story of her life, and
then we’ll go.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“There isn’t really much to tell,” she answered.
“I got a sudden notion in my head that I wanted
to go to the old mill. I thought I would have time
to row over and back before supper. So I just
slipped away in the small canoe, and got to the
place all right.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Weren’t you afraid?” asked Mabel.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What of?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The ghost!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“There wasn’t any when I was there,” went on
pretty breath-of-the-pine-tree, as she leaned back
on some pillows Mabel had put on the cot for her.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I just thought I’d look around and see if I could
discover what it was that looked like a face at the
window that day I saw it. I started up the rickety
old stairs, and I turned on my ankle and slipped
down.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, dear! but it hurt. I tried to get up and I
couldn’t and I didn’t know how long I’d have to
stay there. I called for help, but the place was
deserted since the old hermit moved out. Oh, I
didn’t know what to do.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And weren’t you afraid—horribly afraid?”
asked Marie.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Not first along, I wasn’t. I didn’t imagine what
could harm me. But I was afraid lest I should have
to stay there all night. I knew I could never stand
that.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Did you hear any—ghostly noises?” asked
Mabel, and involuntarily she looked over her shoulder.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Not at first,” answered Natalie, and there was
an obvious reluctance in her manner.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then you <i>did</i> hear something!” exclaimed
Jack, who was watching her closely.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, it sounded like some one crying, or moaning,
I couldn’t tell which. Then I heard what
seemed like some one tramping around in the room
overhead.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Rats!” exclaimed Jack with such suddenness
that all the girls jumped, and Marie screamed.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I think they were pigeons,” went on Natalie,
“and what sounded like moaning was the cooing.
When I had reasoned that out I felt better. Then
I called for help again, and no one answered for
ever so long.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You poor child,” murmured Mrs. Bonnell.
“Did some one finally come?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes; Reuben did.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Good boy for you, Reuben!” exclaimed Blake,
who stood near the farm lad. “I’ll make it all right
with you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Huh! I didn’t do it for pay!” he protested.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Of course not. You didn’t know that you were
entertaining an angel unawares; did you?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Natalie was continuing her story.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Reuben answered me, after a bit,” she said. “I
was never so glad to see any one in all my whole
life as I was to see Reuben. I’ll never forget his
kindness.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“’Twasn’t nothin’!” he protested.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, it was!” insisted Natalie. “He came in,
helped me to get up, and then, by leaning on his
shoulder, I managed to get down to the lake. He
had his boat there, and I got in that, as I thought
I could rest better than in the canoe.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“We towed that back,” put in Reuben. “I tied
it down on shore.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And so here I am,” resumed Natalie. “Oh, I
do hope I’m not going to be laid up.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“If those boys will leave I’ll attend to your
sprain,” said Mrs. Bonnell significantly, and the
young men took the hint and left. With the application
of cloths alternately wrung out of hot
and cold water, Natalie’s ankle was soon much
easier. It was not a bad sprain, as sprains go, and
the Guardian assured her she would be out again in
a couple of days.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then Natalie had to tell the story all over again,
with repetitions of certain parts, while, on their own
behalf, the Camp Fire Girls related how they had
instituted one search, and were about to start another
when the missing one came back.</p>

<p class='c009'>As for the boys they could be heard discussing
the affair in loud voices as the two parties went to
their several camps.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I wonder what’s in that old mill, anyhow?”
ventured Jack.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It must be something,” declared Blake. “I
dare you fellows to come over with me and ‘lay
the ghost,’ as they call it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’ll go!” offered Phil. “It’s a long row,
though, and it’s late.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The lateness is so much the better,” declared
Blake. “Ghosts never perambulate until near midnight,
anyhow. How is it—will you fellows go?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Not for ours,” declared Charlie Taylor, one of
the crowd from the lower camp. “Maybe in the
morning we might consider it. Anyhow, this is
the closed season for ghosts.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You’re afraid!” jeered Blake.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now, don’t let’s think of tackling it to-night,”
suggested Jack. “I’ll go there to-morrow with
any one—or two.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You can’t see ghosts in the day-time!” declared
Blake, as if he were an authority on spirits.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Who said we would look for them in daylight,”
returned Jack. “We can go to the mill to-morrow
afternoon, and wait until it gets dark. We can take
our lunch with us.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That sounds good,” declared Phil. “I’m in on
that.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, if you want to do it that way, I’m willing,”
assented Blake. “Probably all we’ll find,
though, is some tramp sleeping in the shack.
Very well, we’ll lay the ghost to-morrow.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And we won’t tell the girls about it until we
solve the mystery,” added Phil.</p>

<p class='c009'>“That’s what,” added Jack.</p>

<p class='c009'>But the next day it rained, so they postponed their
ghost-hunting expedition. There was nothing
much to do, though, so in the afternoon the boys
donned old garments, and went over to the Point,
through the drizzle, for some supplies, shopping for
the girls at the same time.</p>

<p class='c009'>Natalie’s ankle was better, it was reported, and
the following day she could hobble about a bit.</p>

<p class='c009'>“But I’m going to sit still and do bead work for
a while,” she said when the boys came to call, and
she showed where, on a hand loom, she was working
a Camp Fire device for a bead head-band—her
emblem of a pine tree being made in a conventional
design. The other girls were also busy.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then you’re not going to the mill again?”
asked Jack.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, indeed!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Late that afternoon, giving out some excuse
to the girls not to see them that evening, the three
chums, having packed a basket of lunch, with some
candles for light, some bags to use for cushions, set
off for the old mill. They intended to pass the
night there to prove or disprove that any one—whether
of this earth or some other—was in the
ancient structure.</p>

    <div>THE BOYS ARE PUZZLED</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>“It’s a spooky old sort of a place all right,” remarked
Blake.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It sure is,” agreed Phil.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And it’s going to be uncommon uncomfortable
before morning,” declared Jack.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Want to back out?” asked Phil, pausing in the
act of arranging some bags which they had brought
to stretch out on.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Back out? Not on your life!” cried Jack.
“We’d never hear the last of it if the girls found
it out.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“They needn’t know,” suggested Blake. “Not
that I’m anxious to quit, but I thought perhaps——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Say, if those girls were smart enough to find
Bear Pond and the Gypsy camp they’d find out
about us coming here and then backing out,” declared
Jack. “No, we’ve got to stick now, whether
we want to or not. Let’s make the best of it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The boys had brought their things into the old
mill, the reputed mystery of which they intended to
solve. Though what that mystery was, beyond
Old Hanson having declared he had listened to
strange noises of late, was more than the boys could
tell. The face Natalie thought she saw did not particularly
interest them, for, on talking it over, they
had decided that it might have been a pigeon, or a
bat, flying about in the old loft of the mill. And
the creature might have passed close to the broken
window as Natalie looked up.</p>

<p class='c009'>“But it will be something to say we’ve done,”
remarked Jack, arranging the supply of victuals
they had brought, and setting down the lantern.
“We’ll dare the girls to spend a night here—after
we get through.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Maybe they will,” suggested Blake.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Never! Not after we put on the loud pedal
about the rattling of chains that we heard, and the
groans and sighs, invisible hands on the back of
your neck and all the stock-ghost stuff!” exclaimed
Phil. “Bur-r-r-r! I can hear ’em scream now.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, let’s get busy and talk afterward,” suggested
Jack. “I don’t believe anything will happen.
Old Hanson imagined it all. There may be a stray
tramp or so sleeping in here once in a while, or
perhaps some of the Gypsy men.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then it wouldn’t be safe for the girls to come,”
said Blake.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don’t worry—they won’t come within a mile
of the place!” exclaimed Phil. “But what are we
going to do all night?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Play checkers and dominoes, taking turns at it,”
came from Jack. “I brought both games along.
Then we’ll divide the watches, and each one stand
his share. That, with eating and talking, will make
morning come fast enough.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Now, that they were fully committed to the matter,
the boys felt that it was not such a foolish
piece of business after all.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Old Hanson will be glad to know there isn’t a
ghost here,” said Jack. “He’ll want to come back
here in the winter I guess. We’ll lay the haunt for
him if there is one.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Night was coming on, so the boys lighted one of
the two lanterns they had brought. They had taken
up their quarters in what had evidently been one of
the living rooms of the old structure in its Colonial
days, for there was a big stone fireplace in the
apartment.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We’ll make believe we belong to the Camp Fire
Girls, and have a blaze there,” said Phil, as he
brought in some wood. “There, I’m a Wood
Gatherer,” he added with a laugh, “you can be a
Fire Starter, Blake and Jack will be Chief Cook and
Bottle-washer.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Do you think it’s safe to start a fire in that
crazy old chimney?” asked Jack, as Blake piled the
wood up on two bricks to make a draft under it.
Then he set a match to the fagots.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, I guess it’s safe enough,” was the answer.
“I remember Old Hanson had a fire here years
ago.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, but if a spark sets fire to the old shebang
it’ll go like tinder,” declared Jack.</p>

<p class='c009'>“That’ll be the last of the ghost, at all events,”
was Blake’s reply. “Now stop being fussy, and
let’s enjoy ourselves. Where are the rest of the
sandwiches?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“If we eat ’em all up now there won’t be any
for the middle of the night,” warned Phil.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Who cares. You’ve got to eat when you’re
hungry. Pass ’em over!”</p>

<p class='c009'>The boys had dressed warmly, and in old clothes,
so they did not mind sitting around on the broken
boxes that did duty for chairs. Another box made
a table for the checker-board and the dominoes, and
they took turns playing.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was chilly and draughty in the old structure,
but the fire made it more cheerful than otherwise it
would have been, and the boys really began rather
to enjoy their odd adventure.</p>

<p class='c009'>“But if only the ghost would walk!” exclaimed
Phil about nine o’clock.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Hark! What’s that?” exclaimed Blake in a
whisper.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The wind rattling some of the old windows,”
answered Jack. “Go on—it’s your move.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m going to move to bed,” yawned Phil. “You
fellows can wake me up when it’s my turn to
watch.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Go ahead,” assented Jack, for he and Blake
had to finish the deciding game of checkers, and it
was at an interesting stage just then.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was harder to awaken Phil than they thought,
when the two decided to stretch out on the old bags
about twelve o’clock. Nothing had disturbed them,
and as Phil, stretching and yawning, got up he remarked:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Say, this isn’t as much fun as I thought it
would be. What will one of you fellows take to
stand watch for me?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Go on! Do your duty!” exclaimed Blake.</p>

<p class='c009'>He and Jack made themselves as comfortable as
they could on the floor, with the bags for mattresses;
and they got close to the fire, for the night
seemed to get colder. There was plenty of wood,
however.</p>

<p class='c009'>Probably Phil tried not to go to sleep—he said
afterward that it couldn’t have been more than a
minute that he dozed off, but the fact was that it
was getting daylight when he awoke again.</p>

<p class='c009'>He sat up, rubbing his eyes in surprise, and, for
a moment, hardly able to remember where he was.
Then he saw Jack stretching and yawning, and
Blake turning over.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, what a hard bed!” complained Jack.
Then something seemed to recall a matter to him,
and he cried out: “Why didn’t you call me Phil,
to stand my second trick; eh?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Because—er—I,” stammered Phil.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Say, you slept the rest of the night through
after we woke you that time!” cried Blake.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well—er—I guess I did. But so did you fellows!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But, you didn’t call us,” objected Jack. “How
could we? Say, we’re hot ghost-hunters, we are!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t believe there is any such animal,” declared
Blake. “Come on, let’s finish up the sandwiches
and get back to camp. The girls may have
been looking for us, and be worried when they find
we’re not home.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Jack was looking about with a puzzled expression.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Say, fellows,” he began, “didn’t we have two
lanterns with us?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“We sure did,” answered Phil.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, there’s only one here now, and all those
sandwiches are gone.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Rats!” exclaimed Blake.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, they are, I’m not joking,” protested Jack.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, I used the word rats in its real meaning—not
as slang,” explained Blake. “I meant that rats
had carried off the sandwiches.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, they didn’t carry off a lantern,” declared
Phil. “That’s sure. And my knife is gone. I left
it on the checker-board.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And my match-box!” cried Blake. “The
one——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Never mind her name—we know who gave it
to you!” mocked Jack. “But, fellows, this is queer.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The three chums looked at each other. Then
Blake said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“The ghost was here while we all slept last
night. Fellows, as ghost-layers we’re miserable
failures, but I know one thing.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What?” demanded Phil.</p>

<p class='c009'>“That it’s a pretty healthy ghost who can eat
sandwiches, and who wants a lantern, matches and
a knife. Let’s have a look around.”</p>

    <div>THE GIRLS WILL GO</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>“Where in the world were you boys?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“We’ve been worried to death about you!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why didn’t you tell us you were going to be
out all night?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“My! They look as though they’d slept in a
barn!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Thus the girls greeted the return of—shall I
say our three heroes—a little later that morning.
They certainly did not feel like heroes, however,
as they rowed up to the little dock, and saw the
Camp Fire Girls waiting for them on shore.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, we’ve been off on a little trip,” said Blake.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You don’t look as though you enjoyed it much,
or as if it did you any good,” said Mrs. Bonnell
dryly. “Come on now, ’fess up and we’ll forgive
you. But we were worried.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why so?” asked Jack, thinking to postpone the
explanation.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why, Alice had a letter from home on the last
mail, and there was some news in it she wanted to
tell Blake. We walked over to your camp, and
found it deserted. Then some of the boys whom
you got to help us search for Natalie, that time,
came along and invited us out in their launch.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Did you go?” asked Phil.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Certainly,” said his sister. “And we had a
fine dance at the Point. All but poor Natalie—she
couldn’t on account of her ankle, and I just
know that Harry Morton got up the whole thing
on her account.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“He did not!” protested the blushing Natalie,
while Blake looked at her sharply.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then, on our way back, we stopped at your
camp again,” went on the Guardian, “and you
weren’t there. Naturally we were worried.
Now—where were you?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, just off on a sleuthing expedition,” said Jack
airily. “Say, don’t you want to invite us to breakfast?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“We will if you tell us where you were,” challenged
Mabel.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I think I can guess,” said Natalie.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Where?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“In the old mill.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“How did you—er—<i>guess</i>?” asked Blake.</p>

<p class='c009'>“He was going to say <i>know</i>—he was going to
ask how you knew!” laughed Marie. “Oh, Nat,
you hit it!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Supposing we were there?” challenged Phil.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Did you find the ghost?” asked Mrs. Bonnell.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Phil fell asleep and didn’t keep watch,” said
Jack accusingly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I didn’t sleep any more than you fellows did.
We were all in the same boat,” came from the aggrieved
one.</p>

<p class='c009'>The girls were laughing.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Better make a clean breast of it,” suggested
Marie. “We won’t tell any one else.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Do you promise?” asked Blake.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Sure!” came in a chorus.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then, I’ll tell, to get square with Phil for
sleeping while that ghost came down, took what
remained of our sandwiches, our best lantern, and
my knife and match-box.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Did it do that?” cried Mabel.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It sure did!” cried Jack.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What—what did <i>it</i> look like?” whispered
Natalie. “That face I saw——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“We didn’t see a thing,” declared Blake, “nor
hear a thing. I tell you we slept through it all like
innocent little babes. The ghost might have carried
us off to its den—that is if ghosts have dens—anyhow
it could have carried us all off for all of
Phil.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Say, you quit!” begged the badgered one.
“I’m no worse than either of you two. I’ll tell
you something, girls.”</p>

<p class='c009'>And he proceeded to relate how, taking the first
watch, he had slumbered through it, but how his
chums were equally responsible.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s too bad,” said Marie. “All your work
gone for nothing!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, we had a good time,” said Blake. “But
we’re dead tired now. It was harder work than
going fishing.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Come on in and we’ll give you some coffee,”
invited Natalie and the boys eagerly availed themselves
of the chance.</p>

<p class='c009'>At breakfast they talked over again their experiences
of the night. The girls were very nice about
it, and didn’t laugh any more than they really felt
obliged to.</p>

<p class='c009'>“But it is certainly killing!” cried Alice, “to
think of you three big fellows going after one poor,
innocent little ghost and then letting yourselves be
robbed in that fashion.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That’s right,” said Blake, grinning sheepishly.
“And it was my best knife, too. Talk about taking
candy from a baby!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What was the matter with you, Phil?” asked
his sister. “Why didn’t you carry an alarm clock?
I’ll lend you my little square one if you want to
make another try.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Say, look here!” burst out Phil. “If you girls
think it so easy to stay up all night, why don’t you
try a watch meeting in the old mill? Why don’t
you try to solve this mystery if you’re so smart?”
and he fairly glared at his sister.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Maybe we will,” she said coolly. “Have some
more coffee, Philly; and don’t let your temper get
the best of you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well,” he grumbled. “I guess anybody
would.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, it was a joke on us all right,” assented
Blake. “We might as well take our medicine, fellows.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The boys were in better humor after breakfast,
and left for their camp, promising to try and get
their launch in running order and take the girls
out for a ride that afternoon.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And we want to have another try for our
canoe,” said Jack. “It won’t do to let that get
away from us.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Girls! Will you do it?” cried Natalie with
eager, shining eyes when the boys had gone.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Do what?” asked Mabel.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Try to find the ghost of the old mill—or whoever
is hiding there.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Do you think some one is hiding there?” inquired
Marie.</p>

<p class='c009'>“There must be—to take the boys’ things. And
they said they made a good search all over the mill
this morning, after they discovered their loss. They
couldn’t find a trace, though.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then how can <i>we</i>?” asked Alice.</p>

<p class='c009'>“<i>We</i> have better luck,” went on Natalie. “Look
how we found the Gypsy camp. Besides, I have a
theory.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What about?” Mrs. Bonnell wanted to
know.</p>

<p class='c009'>“About the hiding-place of the ghost. I think
there must be a secret room in the old mill. There
almost always was, in old colonial houses, you
know.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And what makes you think some one is hiding
there?” asked Mabel.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Because of the way the boys’ things disappeared.
Why, listen! Maybe some criminal is hiding
in the old mill, and only dares come out at
night.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“A criminal-ghost or a ghost-criminal?” asked
Marie with a laugh.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Either or both.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And you want us to spend a night there? Ugh!
Excuse me—never!” declared Alice.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t mean stay there all night,” explained
Natalie. “We could get the other camping boys—the
ones who took us over to the Point last night—to
run us to the mill in their launch. Then they
could go off and leave us—or stay within call, maybe,
and we could search all over the place for the
secret room. I’m almost sure we can find it—I’m
always lucky that way.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I wish you’d find mother’s diamond ring then,”
said Mabel with a sigh.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Will you come, girls?” persisted Natalie.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We’ll come home before dark; won’t we?”
asked Alice.</p>

<p class='c009'>“If you like; but it’s going to be a lovely moonlight
night, and it will be grand on the water.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why not ask our own boys to take us over?”
suggested Mrs. Bonnell.</p>

<p class='c009'>“They wouldn’t,” said Mabel. “I think Nat’s
plan is good—but I won’t stay in that spooky place
after dark.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then we’ll go!” cried Natalie.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes,” came in rather indifferent and hesitating
accents from the others.</p>

    <div>THE WEEPING VOICE</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>“Where are you girls going?”</p>

<p class='c009'>It was Jack who demanded this of his sister and
the other Camp Fire devotees as they filed past
Stony Point a day or so after the fiasco in the old
mill.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Evidently they’re going to make a day of it,”
observed Blake. “They’ve got their lunch,” and
he glanced significantly at several baskets the girls
carried.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And their knitting, too,” added Phil.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Thank you. This isn’t knitting,” responded
Natalie, as she waved a string of colored beads,
woven into a broad band. “These are going to
be our—is it totem poles, girls?” and she appealed
to the others.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Totem poles!” cried Blake. “Say, you’re not
Alaska Indians! Totem poles are those telegraph
spiles carved with beasts and birds, and colored like
a Chinese rainbow, that you see in the museums!
Totem Poles! Oh my!” and he doubled up with
mirth.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, it’s something on that order, anyhow,”
went on Natalie. “These are our head-bands.
Mine is almost finished,” and she showed her
pretty conventionalized design of a dark-green pine
tree on a turquoise-blue background.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Are you going to weave some of those to-day?”
asked Phil. “That’s the way with girls.
They go off in the woods for a day’s outing, and
trot along a book, or some of that filmy lace stuff,
and that’s how they enjoy themselves.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, it’s just as much fun for us, as it is for
you boys to lie around doing nothing, or cutting
fish poles or—or—whatever you do,” said Alice,
rather at a loss for comparisons.</p>

<p class='c009'>“But where are you bound for?” persisted
Blake.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, off for a day in the woods,” said Mrs.
Bonnell, noncommittally.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Aren’t we coming?” inquired Phil.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Not this time, little boy. Run along and finish
doing your breakfast dishes,” mocked Marie.
“We’re going out riding with some better-looking
chaps than you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Meaning those fellows from We-Too camp?”
demanded Jack.</p>

<p class='c009'>“They happen to be going to take us,” said
Natalie. “And we’ll be sure of getting there and
getting back.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Meaning a knock at our faithful old gasoline
craft,” put in Blake. “All right, young ladies, if
you do get stuck you needn’t signal us for a tow.
You can walk home. Come on, fellows, we’re insulted,”
and he stalked back into the tent.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Come on, girls, or we’ll be late,” urged Mabel.
“Have we got everything?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“If we haven’t we can’t carry any more,” declared
Natalie. “I wonder if I’ll do any work on
my bead head-band now that I’ve toted it along with
me, and the loom, too,” and she regarded it rather
regretfully.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, we’ll have lots of time to make bead
work,” said Alice. “It won’t take us long to explore
the old mill, and then we can pic-nic and do
as we please.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then you don’t believe we’ll find anything?”
asked Natalie.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Not a blessed thing, my dear,” answered Alice,
“except cobwebs, with big, fat spiders in them——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, you horrid thing!” cried Mabel. “I’ll not
set foot in the old place!” and she hung back.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We’ll get a broom and brush them all down,”
said Mrs. Bonnell. “There are the boys beckoning
to us. Hurry, my dears!”</p>

<p class='c009'>They had passed along the lake shore beyond
the camp of Jack and his chums, and were now approaching
the We-Too aggregation of tents, this
being the name adopted by the young men who had
assisted in the search for Natalie that night. They
had been friends with the girls and their brothers
since.</p>

<p class='c009'>“My! you’re equipped for a long stay,” remarked
Ford Armstrong, one of the campers, as he saw the
well-laden girls and their guardian. “Let me take
some of your bundles.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And whatever you do, don’t drop that basket!”
cautioned Alice. “It’s got eggs in it, and some of
them may not be hard-boiled.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“There are olives in here, so don’t you dare drop
this,” added Mabel, surrendering her bundle to
Harry Watson.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And you really want to stay around that old
mill all day?” questioned Ford, as he helped them
into the waiting launch.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Hush! Not so loud!” cautioned Mrs. Bonnell.
“We don’t want our boys to know about it, but
we’re going to bait the ghost there you see.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And here is some of the bait,” laughed Mabel,
pointing to the baskets of food.</p>

<p class='c009'>“All right, we’ll keep your secret,” promised
Wentworth Jones. “What time shall we come
back for you?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Before dark; or we’ll never speak to you again,”
threatened Alice.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, but I thought, with the moonlight—” began
Natalie.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Natalie Fuller! if you want to stay around that
spooky old mill after dark you may!” exclaimed
Marie, “but I’m not going to. It’s all right in daylight,
but when the shades of night begin falling
fast, I want to be in my own little tent. So don’t
you boys fail to come before dark.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The gallant escort promised and then, observed
by the envious eyes of Jack and his chums, the
Camp Fire Girls, and their new friends, puffed
away in the launch across the lake toward the old
mill.</p>

<p class='c009'>They reached it without incident, disembarked
and were soon at the ancient structure, their friends
carrying up the lunch and other impedimenta.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And now we shall leave you to your fates,”
said Ford Armstrong, with mock heroics.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And don’t forget about coming after us,”
warned Mabel, shaking a finger at him.</p>

<p class='c009'>Laughingly the boys promised once more, and
then departed in their launch, rather wishing the
girls had asked them to stay.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now we must begin our search!” declared
Natalie. “We will work a while and then rest,
eat and string beads, and do some more searching.
I’m going to find that secret room!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Natalie will insist on that,” remarked Mabel.
“Oh, what a scary place!” she added, as she looked
around the gloomy old mill.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Hark!” called Marie softly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, what is it?” demanded Alice, grasping the
arm of Natalie.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don’t!” begged the other. “That’s my sore
place—where the briars scratched me.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Sillies! It isn’t anything but the wind rattling,”
said Mrs. Bonnell. “If you’re going to
scream at every sound we might as well stop now.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, let’s begin!” cried Natalie. “I do so
want to beat the boys at their own game. Come
on, I’ll lead the way,” and she darted toward the
stairs.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Be careful,” warned the guardian, “you don’t
want to sprain your ankle again.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And those stairs aren’t any too safe,” added
Marie.</p>

<p class='c009'>But they managed to get up them in safety, and
found themselves in an upper story of the mill.
There were remains of old machinery, now rusted
and broken, and big bins for the storage of grain.</p>

<p class='c009'>The mill was a rambling structure, that seemed
to have been built on and added to from time to
time. It had also served as a home for the families
of the various millers. There were passage-ways
leading from room to room, sometimes little flights
of steps necessitated because the floors were on
different levels. But, as far as the girls could see,
there was no place for any substantial creature to
hide.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Though of course ghosts could stow themselves
away in a rat hole,” observed Mabel.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don’t say ghosts and rats up here,” begged
Marie.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Let’s go down stairs and look around,” suggested
Natalie. “We’ll make a fire, if we can find
anything, and be cosy as we sit about it. Then
we can eat when we’re ready. Did you bring that
box of candy, Mabel?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I did—what’s left of it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh! nearly five pounds gone since the first of
the week!” exclaimed Mrs. Bonnell. “Girls, your
indigestions will be ruined!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Good!” laughed Alice.</p>

<p class='c009'>Their search down stairs was no more fruitful.
They passed through room after room, where the
grinding of various grist had been done years ago.
Here was more machinery, all in ruins. They
peered out at the moss-covered mill-wheel, broken
and shattered, below which was trickling a little
stream of water.</p>

<p class='c009'>But of ghosts, real or fancied, there was not a
trace. There were even no unusual noises, though
Mabel remarked that night was the time for them.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, let’s make a fire,” suggested Natalie.
“It’s damp and chilly in here. The boys have left
us enough wood,” she said, as they all got back to
the room where the fireplace was.</p>

<p class='c009'>They kindled a little blaze, and were sitting about
it, talking and laughing. Mabel was getting out
the box of candy when Natalie, who was sitting
nearest the chimney, raised her hand for silence.</p>

<p class='c009'>They all listened.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What is it?” whispered Mabel.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Hush!” cautioned Natalie.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then they all became aware of a faint, moaning
cry. It was like some one sobbing at a distance.</p>

<p class='c009'>The girls, with wide-opened eyes, looked at one
another. Natalie softly arose and leaned nearer
the opening of the fireplace.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Come here!” she whispered to her companions.</p>

<p class='c009'>On tiptoes they stole to her side. They could
now hear more plainly the sobbing voice.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s the ghost—crying!” whispered Natalie.
“We have found it!”</p>

    <div>THE SECRET ROOM</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>“What shall we do?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Let’s run!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, if—the boys were only here!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Thus three voices whispered. Natalie was so
busy listening at the chimney, turning her head
this way and that, to better catch the sound that
came down the flue, that she did not speak.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Girls, be sensible!” commanded Mrs. Bonnell
in a low voice. “It isn’t anything but the wind in
the chimney.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It is not the wind,” said Natalie, softly.
“Listen!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Overcoming their natural eerie fears the Camp
Fire Girls did listen. The sobbing was fainter
now.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Girls!” exclaimed Natalie firmly, seeming to
become imbued with a new courage, “that’s some
poor creature in trouble. We’ve got to help!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But—but suppose it’s one of those <i>criminals</i>,”
suggested Alice, giving a glance over her shoulder.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Criminals don’t cry—that way,” declared Natalie.
“They aren’t sorry enough to cry—until
after they’re arrested.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But how can we help this—this person when
he is up the chimney?” asked Mabel.</p>

<p class='c009'>“How do you know it’s a ‘he’?” asked Marie.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, call it the ghost, then,” admitted Mabel.
“How are we going to rescue the ghost from the
chimney.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It isn’t in the chimney,” went on Natalie, who
seemed to have assumed charge of matters. “Only
the sound comes down that way. I understand it
all now. The secret room is near the chimney.
The ghost is in the secret room.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“She <i>will</i> have that secret room!” murmured
Marie.</p>

<p class='c009'>“There is some poor person in trouble,” went
on Natalie. “Maybe he fell and sprained its ankle
and she can’t walk, just as I did.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, what a beautiful mixture of personal pronouns!”
laughed Alice, and the laugh seemed to
relieve the strain on the nerves of all of them.
“Well, Nat, what are your plans?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“We must find that secret room.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes; but how?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Listen, girls. It must be near the chimney.
Probably some stovepipe hole leads into this flue,
and the draught carried the sound downward. All
we have to do is to make another search upstairs
near where the chimney passes through.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Simple as a problem in geometry,” murmured
Alice, who detested the study. “Lead on, Nat!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Will you come?” asked breath-of-the-pine-tree,
looking at her companions.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, I suppose it might be some one in trouble,”
agreed Mrs. Bonnell. “But— Oh, well, I
guess there are enough of us,” and she picked up
from the floor a stout cudgel. “We had better
arm ourselves,” she added. “There may be——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Rats!” broke in Marie.</p>

<p class='c009'>“She is fined a pound of candy for saying that!”
exclaimed Natalie. “Come on,” and she led the
way.</p>

<p class='c009'>Now that they had some definite plan of searching
they felt more assured of success. There were
two upper stories to the old mill, but the girls had
given only a casual glance around the third one, as
it was so dark and gloomy that they did not fancy
remaining in it. Now it became practically certain
that, if there was a secret room, it would be on the
third floor, for a look around the place where the
big chimney passed through the second floor, showed
that there was no room for a hidden recess.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We’ve got to go up there,” said Natalie firmly,
as they came to a pause at the foot of the second
flight of stairs.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Hark!” cautioned Marie.</p>

<p class='c009'>As they listened they heard again the sound of
the crying voice.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Who is there?” called Mrs. Bonnell sharply.</p>

<p class='c009'>There was no answer.</p>

<p class='c009'>Natalie said afterward that she did not know how
she got the courage to do it, but she started up the
stairs, and the others, after a moment of hesitation,
followed. Natalie hurried on. She saw a
small window, through which the light streamed,
filtering in between cracks in the ancient shutter.</p>

<p class='c009'>With the stick she carried, she shoved this back,
letting in a beam of sunlight. There was a flutter
of wings, and something flew around the heads of
the Camp Fire Girls.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh!” screamed Mabel and Alice.</p>

<p class='c009'>“They are only bats!” called Mrs. Bonnell.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, but if they get in our hair!” murmured
Mabel, crouching down.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s gone out of the window,” the Guardian
assured them.</p>

<p class='c009'>Natalie was busily scanning the wall near the
chimney. The girls stole to her side.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Listen!” commanded Natalie in a whisper.</p>

<p class='c009'>Faintly they heard a moan. It seemed to come
from inside the big chimney. Natalie took a step
toward it. Her eyes roved over the ancient paneling.
One section seemed to be darker colored
than the rest.</p>

<p class='c009'>Natalie pressed on this, hardly knowing why, for
it bore no semblance to a door. But she nearly
stumbled and fell as the panel unexpectedly gave
way, and there was disclosed the secret room they
had been looking for.</p>

    <div>HADEE</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Natalie grasped the edges of the doorway so
unexpectedly opened before her, and clung there.
The light shot into the secret room, revealing a
figure huddled up in one corner—a timid, shrinking
form, from which faint moans came.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s a girl!” gasped Mrs. Bonnell. “The poor
creature!”</p>

<p class='c009'>The figure in the corner raised itself up, and
stared at the intruders.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Water—water,” moaned the girl. “I am so
sick!”</p>

<p class='c009'>As the eyes of the Camp Fire Girls became more
accustomed to the semi-gloom of the room, they
caught a glimpse of the gay colors in the dress of
the figure in the corner.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s Hadee! The Gypsy!” gasped Natalie.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, I am Hadee,” murmured the girl. “You
have found me. Oh, I am so glad! I feared no
one ever would. I thought I would die here, and—my
leg is broken!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, you poor creature!” cried Mrs. Bonnell.
“Girls, we must have a doctor right away. Marie,
run down to the shore and see if you can find a
boat anywhere about. Signal to them—wave your
handkerchief—scream!</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mabel, see if you can get me some water—bring
it in anything—in some of the dishes—in our
baskets. Natalie, get me some sticks I can use for
splints to bind up her leg until the doctor can get
here. Alice, you help me with—her,” and she motioned
toward the Gypsy girl.</p>

<p class='c009'>Thus did the Guardian effectually assume charge
of matters. It was the best thing she could have
done to take the minds of her charges off the startling
events that had happened in the last few minutes.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Which leg is it, dear?” asked Mrs. Bonnell, as
she went over to the figure in the corner. “I’ll try
not to hurt you, but—I must look at it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The right one. I fell night before last as I
was coming up the stairs, but I managed to drag
myself in here.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And you’ve been here alone ever since?” asked
Natalie.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, and I thought I would die.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Mrs. Bonnell was examining the broken leg. It
was a simple fracture, but considerable inflammation
had set in from the neglect, and when the injured
leg was touched ever so gently there came a
moan of pain from the stricken girl.</p>

<p class='c009'>Hadee had raised herself up on her elbow, while
Mrs. Bonnell was pouring cold water on the fracture
and binding it up.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh!” moaned the Gypsy girl, and then she
fell back senseless.</p>

<p class='c009'>“She’s dead!” gasped Mabel.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Nonsense, it’s only a faint. Sprinkle some
water on her face while I finish binding up this
leg,” said Mrs. Bonnell. “She’ll come to all right.
Loosen her dress at the neck.”</p>

<p class='c009'>As Mabel did this something rolled out of the
upper part of the insensible girl’s garment. It was
something that gleamed and sparkled in the light.</p>

<p class='c009'>“My mother’s diamond ring!” cried Mabel seizing
it.</p>

<p class='c009'>Hadee opened her eyes.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I—was going to—give it back,” she murmured.
“That is why—I ran away from the—from the
camp—so they wouldn’t take it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“There now, don’t talk,” soothed Mrs. Bonnell.
“You can tell us all about it when you feel better.
We’ll make you as comfortable as we can until the
doctor comes. I hope Marie can manage to find
some one to send.”</p>

<p class='c009'>There was a tramping of feet on the floor below.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Some one is coming!” cried Natalie.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s the boys—our boys!” exclaimed Mabel.
“Oh, how good!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“They mustn’t come in here!” decided Mrs.
Bonnell. “There has been enough excitement for
Hadee. I must keep her quiet. Natalie, you and
Mabel slip down and tell them what has happened.
Then one of you bring back some more water,
and a little of the food. She must be nearly famished.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am—hungry,” admitted Hadee. “But I feel
much better now, I am so glad you—found me.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don’t come up—we’re coming down, boys,”
called Natalie, as she and Mabel started for the
stairs.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What have you found?” demanded Jack, for
it was he and his chums who had come to the old
mill.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The ghost!” said Natalie. “It’s poor little
Hadee—the girl who told our fortunes that time—the
girl who ran away from the Gypsy camp. She’s
hurt. Marie has gone for a doctor. How did you
happen to come here?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, we got lonesome over in camp,” said Blake,
“so we thought we’d just take a run over here to
say how—do.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m so glad you did!” exclaimed Natalie, with
a grateful look at him.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’ll take up some food and water,” spoke Mabel.
“Then I’ll come back. You might see if
Marie has been able to signal any one, Phil,” she
said to her brother.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Here’s Marie now,” spoke Jack, as the girl
came flying into the mill.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Did you send for a doctor?” asked Natalie.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I have mother’s diamond ring back!” cried
Mabel, holding up the sparkling gem.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Say, these girls beat anything for finding
things!” declared Jack.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Hadee had it,” explained Mabel. “I’m so
glad.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What about the doctor?” asked Natalie.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I met Old Hanson,” Marie said. “He said
he’d go right back and get one. Dr. Morse is at
some house down the road now most fortunately,
and Old Hanson said he’d have him come here. I
met the hermit on the road as I was running to the
lake shore.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Everything seems to be coming out for the
best,” said Jack. “Now let’s have some details.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Natalie and Marie gave such as they knew to the
boys, while Mabel took up the food and water to
Alice and Mrs. Bonnell, who had remained with
the Gypsy girl.</p>

<p class='c009'>“But what is she doing in this old mill?” asked
Blake. “And what makes you think she is the
ghost?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t know why she is here,” said Natalie,
“except that she ran away from the Gypsy camp
for some reason or other, and this was the best
place to hide.</p>

<p class='c009'>“As for her being the ghost—here is your knife
and match-box, Blake. I found them in her room,”
and she extended the articles to him.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Stung!” gasped Jack.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And by a girl,” added Phil.</p>

<p class='c009'>“So it was Hadee who stole down and took our
things while we were asleep,” murmured Blake.</p>

<p class='c009'>There was the sound of wheels outside.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Here’s the doctor!” exclaimed Natalie.</p>

<div class='chapter'>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c007'>
    <div>RESTORATION</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>“Well, it isn’t as bad as it might be,” said Dr.
Morse after he had examined Hadee. “Of course
it would have been better to have had the bone set
sooner, but there’s no great harm done. But I
must get her to some other place than this to work
over her. I haven’t room here.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Take her to our camp,” proposed Natalie.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, she wouldn’t ride well in a boat. I’ll just
send Old Hanson back for a farm wagon, and have
him put a mattress in it. She can ride on that as
well as in an ambulance. I guess the Richardson’s
will take her in. They have plenty of room. I was
just there on a call when Hanson found me. Mr.
Richardson has a little bilious attack. This girl
will be very comfortable there. His wife is a fine
cook, and they have hired help.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Dr. Morse explained to Old Hanson what was
wanted, and the hermit started off after the wagon.
Hadee was gotten downstairs, and made as comfortable
as possible.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Camp Fire Girls were anxious to hear her
story but Dr. Morse would not let her talk.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It will do later,” he said. “She has a slight
fever, and I don’t want any more inflammation in
that leg than I can help.”</p>

<p class='c009'>There was the sound of wheels down the road.
A farm wagon hove in sight, Old Hanson sitting
on the seat beside the driver.</p>

<p class='c009'>As Hadee was carried out the old hermit, who
had been hovering about caught a glimpse of her
face. He started, took a few steps forward,
clutched at his heart and cried:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Girl—girl! Who was your mother?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Hush! We mustn’t have any excitement,”
warned the doctor, thinking the old man’s mind,
never considered strong, was leading him astray.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Her mother! Her mother!” cried Hanson.
“I can see her mother’s face! She is my daughter’s
child—I know it. She has been restored to
me! Oh, child, where is your mother?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now—now!” protested Dr. Morse. “You
can’t——”</p>

<p class='c009'>But Hanson had pushed his way forward, and
was now beside the wagon, in which Hadee lay
on the mattress. There was a flush on her pale
face.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What does he mean?” she asked slowly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t know,” answered Dr. Morse testily.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’ll explain!” said Hanson eagerly. “I’m not
crazy—let me talk. Everybody doesn’t know my
story—some around here do—you do, Dr. Morse.
I tell you that girl is my daughter’s child. Tell
me,” he appealed to Hadee, “do you know who
your mother and father were?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“They are both dead,” she said softly, “but I
have been told that my mother was not a Gypsy.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Of course she was not!” cried Hanson. “She
was my daughter, and she ran away and married
a Gypsy—a handsome chap he was, too. It broke
my heart—it made me lose all hope in life. But
now my granddaughter is restored to me. And so
you were the ghost of the mill?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I hid there after I ran away,” said Hadee. “I
wouldn’t do as they wanted me to——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You had better not talk, dear,” said Mrs. Bonnell
gently placing her hand on the girl’s hot forehead.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, well, maybe she’ll feel better to have it over
with,” said Dr. Morse resignedly. “Are you sure
about this, Hanson?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Positive. She is the image of my lost daughter.
She must have a birth-mark on her neck—all
the Rossmore’s had it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“There is a mark there,” said Natalie. “I saw
it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And are you really my grandfather?” murmured
Hadee.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I sure am, girl.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then I’m not a Gypsy.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Only half; and you won’t be that much any
more. You’re coming to live with me. I’ve got a
little money put away, and we’ll live for each other
now. I couldn’t keep my daughter—maybe I was
too harsh with her—but I won’t be with you,
Hadee,” and he gazed lovingly at her.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now, this will just have to stop!” declared Dr.
Morse firmly. “I insist on the patient being kept
quiet. She may be your daughter’s child, Hanson,
but if you want to keep her with you don’t set her
into more of a fever than she has already. Drive
on, Pete. I’ll follow in my carriage. See you
later,” he called to the Camp Fire Girls and their
boy friends.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, what do you know about this?” gasped
Jack, as the carriage of the doctor and the other
wagon disappeared down the road. “You girls
have certainly beaten us all to pieces! You discover
the ghost, get back the diamond ring and restore
a long-lost child to her grandfather. Wow!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Tell us all about it,” demanded Blake.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We can’t until we hear Hadee’s story,” said
Natalie.</p>

<p class='c009'>And they heard that the next day. The broken
leg had been set, and put in a plaster cast. Then,
with the permission of Dr. Morse, Hadee, sitting
up in bed in the Richardson home, told her story.</p>

<p class='c009'>She had been with the Gypsy band all her life,
traveling about the country. When she became old
enough her mother had told her something of the
tragedy of her own story. Hanson Rossmore’s
daughter had met a handsome Gypsy lad, and fallen
in love with him. Her father opposed her, but she
ran away and was legally married to him. Then,
feeling unable to return to her father, the girl took
up a life with the nomads. Hadee was the only
child, and when her parents died she remained with
the tribe. She became one of the best fortune
tellers.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was Hadee who called at the Anderson home
that night the ring disappeared.</p>

<p class='c009'>“But I did not take it,” she said. “It fell down
from the table into the folds of my sash. I discovered
it when I got back to camp, but Neezar, who
calls herself our queen, would not let me take it
back. Then the camp was quickly moved away,
and I did not have a chance to return—the diamond.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I kept it with me, however, refusing to give it
up, though they tried to make me. Life was very
hard. Then came the taking of the farmer’s wife’s
pocket-book. I did not do that, it was another of
our band who used my name. When I heard of
the trouble I tried to run away, but they watched
me too close.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Finally I got the chance, and, I came to this old
mill. I stayed here nights and went out by day, as
I could, to get food. I guess I took something
from my grandfather here, and from your camp,”
she said, with a shy smile at the boys. “I needed
things. There was a handkerchief——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mine—but you may keep it,” said Blake.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And the canoe,” went on Hadee. “The boat
I came in drifted away.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Jove! It’s good to get that canoe back,” said
Jack.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s hidden back of the mill,” went on the Gypsy
girl. “I have stayed here ever since.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And was it your face I saw at the window?”
asked Natalie.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes,” assented Hadee. “I was afraid you
would come and find me that time. Then I found
the secret room, and stayed there. I stole softly
down in the night when the boys were here, and
took some of their things when they were asleep,”
she said shyly. “I needed them.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, we were easy marks,” admitted Phil with
a laugh.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I needed the knife and matches,” the Gypsy
girl went on, “but I’ll give them back. The food
I ate.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You’re welcome to it,” said Blake kindly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I also took a few things from your camp,” she
said to the girls.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The olives and sardines?” asked Marie.</p>

<p class='c009'>Hadee nodded.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I was sorry when—when my grandfather
moved out. I didn’t know he was any relative,”
she resumed. “I didn’t mean to scare him, but
I suppose I did. I cried because I was lonesome
and afraid.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That’s all right!” exclaimed Hanson Rossmore.
“As long as I’ve got some kin now, I don’t
mind. I’m going to sell the old mill—I’ve got an
offer for the property, and we’ll live together where
nothing will remind us of it—Ethel Rose.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ethel!” exclaimed Natalie. They could all see
how much Natalie resembled the Gypsy girl.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, I’m going to call her that,” said the old
man. “I don’t want any more Gypsy names.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, I guess that explains everything,” said
Jack. “So there was no ghost after all.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No. And Natalie proved it!” declared Marie.
“Oh, you dear girl!” and she put her arms around
her chum.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Let’s get back to camp and have a celebration,”
proposed Jack. “We’ll have enough to talk about
for a month.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Hadee, or Ethel Rose Rossmore, to give her the
name she was thenceforth to bear, rapidly recovered
from her accident, and she and her grandfather
made arrangements to board in the village
until he could dispose of his property. The Gypsy
camp was broken up, its members going whither no
one knew. There were many complaints about them
for small thefts, and arrests had been planned but
too late.</p>

<p class='c009'>After all the excitement quiet days followed.
There were Council meetings and camp-fires, walks
in the woods and cruises on the lake, when many
songs were sung. Cora, Gertrude, Edna, Sadie and
Margaret also paid a visit to the woods.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mabel telegraphed the good news of the finding
of the diamond ring to her mother, and the boys
found their missing canoe and lantern where the
Gypsy girl had left them.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And so the mystery of the old mill is settled,”
remarked Blake, as he and Natalie walked along
the lake shore one day.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes. It was like most ghosts—easily accounted
for when you go at it right.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But if it hadn’t been for you it might never
have been solved.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, some one would have found poor little
Hadee if I hadn’t.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Will you come over to the Point and dance
to-night?” asked Blake, after a pause.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, if the others go. We won’t have many
more chances. We are going to break camp next
week.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“So are we. Hasn’t it been a glorious summer?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Indeed, yes. All the girls are delighted with
the Camp Fire idea. They are talking now of a
winter in the woods.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why not?” asked Blake. “A log cabin is
the best place ever, in the snow.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Perhaps we may,” assented Natalie, and as she
and Blake strolled on through the spicy woods,
some one called:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Wo-he-lo! Dogwood camp! Natalie!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“They want me to come back,” said Natalie,
softly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don’t go yet,” begged Blake, and Natalie
stayed.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.</p>

<p>Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE<br />
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK</h2>

<p>To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.</p>

<h3>Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works</h3>

<p>1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.</p>

<p>1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.</p>

<p>1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.</p>

<p>1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.</p>

<p>1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:</p>

<p>1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:</p>

<blockquote><p>This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United
  States and most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost
  no restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use
  it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with
  this eBook or online
  at <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
  are not located in the United States, you'll have to check the laws
  of the country where you are located before using this
  ebook.</p></blockquote>

<p>1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.</p>

<p>1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.</p>

<p>1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.</p>

<p>1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.</p>

<p>1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that</p>

<ul>
<li>You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."</li>

<li>You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.</li>

<li>You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.</li>

<li>You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.</li>
</ul>

<p>1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.</p>

<p>1.F.</p>

<p>1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.</p>

<p>1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.</p>

<p>1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.</p>

<p>1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.</p>

<p>1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.</p>

<p>1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.  </p>

<h3>Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org.</p>

<h3>Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.</p>

<p>The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

<h3>Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3>Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
